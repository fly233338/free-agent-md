# vphone-cli

Virtual iPhone boot tool using Apple's Virtualization.framework with PCC research VMs.

## Quick Reference

- **Build:** `zsh scripts/build.sh` (builds, signs, and bundles the app)
- **Test:** `swift test`; then `zsh scripts/check_aux.sh` for bundle admission gates
- **Boot (GUI):** `vphone-cli vm launch <name>`
- **Boot (DFU):** `vphone-cli vm launch <name> --dfu`
- **AMFI refuses `vphone-vm`?** Use the bundled `vphone-amfi-allow` helper as shown in `docs/guides/host-setup.md`. Repeat after every build because it allowlists cdhashes. See Key Patterns.
- **Restore:** `vphone-cli restore`, in process. Vendored libirecovery + idevicerestore (`Sources/MobileRecoveryCore`, `Sources/MobileRestoreCore`) over the `AppleMobileDeviceLibrary` xcframeworks. No interpreter, no environment to provision, no setup step. See `research/restore/p2_restore_off_python.md`.
- **Platform:** macOS 15+ (Sequoia). `vphone-vm` needs amfid to accept its private entitlements: either SIP off with `amfi_get_out_of_my_way=1`, or SIP on (`--without debug`) plus an allowlist bypass the user runs. Both are in `docs/guides/host-setup.md`; neither is installed by this project.
- **Language:** Swift 6.0 (SwiftPM), private APIs via [Dynamic](https://github.com/mhdhejazi/Dynamic). This package's own manifest is `swift-tools-version:6.0`, but the **toolchain floor is Swift 6.2**: `libcapstone-spm` declares 6.2 so that it can reach `CSetting.disableWarning` instead of `.unsafeFlags`, which is what lets it be depended on by version at all.
- **Dependencies:** Host and guest SwiftPM packages resolve dependencies by URL and version; `Package.resolved` pins the full graphs. The only git submodule is `scripts/repos/insert_dylib`, a build-time test reference. **No Python anywhere, and no Homebrew package at runtime** — see Tiers below.
- **Tiers.** Three environments run code here and the rules differ. **build** (the machine that builds the `.app`) may use Xcode, `xcrun`, clang, swift, git and Homebrew. **dist** (the shipped `.app`, on a clean macOS) may use `/usr/lib`, `/System` and the bundle — nothing else, no `PATH` lookup. **guest** (inside the VM) is out of host self-containment scope. Every script declares its tier on **line 2** (`# vphone-tier: dist`); `scripts/dist_manifest.sh` reads those and is what `scripts/build.sh` stages from, so a script that declares nothing ships nowhere. `scripts/check_aux.sh` runs the admission gates. The dist tier's registered-exception list is **empty** and a release requires it to stay that way.

## Workflow Rules

- Do not create, read, or update `/TODO.md`.
- Ignore `/TODO.md` if it exists locally; it is intentionally not part of the repo workflow anymore.
- Track plan, progress, assumptions, blockers, and next actions in commit history, code comments when warranted, and current research docs instead of a repo TODO file.

For any changes applying new patches, also update research/0_binary_patch_comparison.md. Dont forget this.

## Local Skills

- If working on kernel analysis, symbolication lookups, or kernel patch reasoning, read `skills/kernel-analysis-vphone600/SKILL.md` first.
- Use this skill as the default procedure for `vphone600` kernel work.

## Firmware Mode

The public CLI exposes only JB: `vphone-cli fw patch` and `vphone-cli cfw install`.
The guest contains vphoned and required system patches; package-manager
bootstrap and first-boot installation are outside this project. Do not add
another public variant.

See `research/` for detailed firmware pipeline, component origins, patch breakdowns, and boot flow documentation.

### Key Patterns

- **Three host binaries, one of them entitled.** `vphone-cli` carries no entitlements, so it launches on any host and is always there to explain what is wrong. `vphone-vm` holds all 7 private keys and is the only thing amfid can refuse. `vphone-archive` does the unpacking. **Do not sign `vphone-cli` with entitlements** — that is how it used to be, and it is why the entry point could not start without a bypass already running.
- **The AMFI bypass is ours, and it writes heap, not code.** `vphone-amfi-allow` (`Sources/VPhoneAMFIAllow/`, this project's copy of [Lakr233/amfi-allow](https://github.com/Lakr233/amfi-allow)) puts the cdhashes of both `vphone-vm` copies into `/Library/Preferences/com.apple.security.coderequirements.plist` — a file AMFI already reads — and flips one byte of `_isRunningInternalBuild` in amfid's `AMFIRequirementsManager` singleton so it consults that file. It is an **allowlist**, scoped to the cdhashes you name; do not describe it as a global switch. The helper's `allow`, `status`, and `off` commands manage it; see `docs/guides/host-setup.md`. It is a **per-build** step, because a cdhash changes with every signature. It must be **arm64e** to match amfid's slice, and `scripts/build.sh` builds it with clang. The heap write is the load-bearing detail: `vphone-letmein` and LLDB-based tools dirty an executable page, and on a host with `vm.cs_system_enforcement = 1` the kernel kills amfid for that and takes the guest with it.
- **Guest launches go through `VPhoneGuestLaunchPlanner`** (`VPhoneCore`). It resolves `vphone-vm` as a sibling of the running image — never through `PATH` — checks its two PV=3 entitlements, then probes with `vphone-vm --help` for SIGKILL. A refusal is reported with the exact command the user has to run; the planner never arranges a bypass itself. Never spawn the guest directly.
- **Restore runs in `vphone-cli`'s own process.** `VPhoneRestore` calls `vphone_restore_run()` in `MobileRestoreCore`; there is no subprocess, no bridge script and no environment to resolve first. The three commands the old Python bridge exposed became `restore --get-shsh`, `restore` and `restore --offline`; its fourth, `usbmux-list`, had no call site and was not ported. `research/restore/p2_restore_off_python.md` has the decision and the behaviour table.
- **Private API access:** Via [Dynamic](https://github.com/mhdhejazi/Dynamic) library (runtime method dispatch from pure Swift). No ObjC bridge.
- **App lifecycle:** `VPhoneVM/main.swift` → `VPhoneGuestApp.run()` → `NSApplication` + `VPhoneVirtualMachineAppDelegate`. Entry points hold no logic.
- **Configuration:** `ArgumentParser` → `VPhoneBootCLI` (in `VPhoneCore`, parsed by both binaries) → `VPhoneVirtualMachine.Options` → `VZVirtualMachineConfiguration`.
- **Guest daemon (vphoned):** SwiftNIO HTTP/WebSocket API on VSOCK 1339, using IcliKit for common device operations. The complete pinned icli CLI is installed inside the guest and available through `icli.execute` with an argv array. `VPhoneGuestControl` reaches HTTP directly over VSOCK; the former length-prefixed service on 1337 is removed. Camera data remains on 1338. The host exposes 1339 only when boot is given `--api-listen`.
- **Menu system:** `VPhoneMenuController` + per-menu extensions (Keys, Type, Location, Connect, Install, Record).
- **File browser:** SwiftUI (`VPhoneFileBrowserView` + `VPhoneFileBrowserModel`) in `NSHostingController`. Search, sort, upload/download, drag-drop via `VPhoneGuestControl`.
- **IPA installation:** `VPhoneIPAInstaller` extracts + re-signs via `VPhoneSigner` + installs over vsock.
- **Screen recording:** `VPhoneScreenRecorder` captures VM display. Controls via Record menu.

## Coding Conventions

### Swift

- **Language:** Swift 6.0 (strict concurrency).
- **Style:** Pragmatic, minimal. No unnecessary abstractions.
- **Sections:** Use `// MARK: -` to organize code within files.
- **Access control:** Default (internal). Only mark `private` when needed for clarity.
- **Concurrency:** `@MainActor` for VM and UI classes. `nonisolated` delegate methods use `MainActor.isolated {}` to hop back safely.
- **Naming:** Types are `VPhone`-prefixed. Match Apple framework conventions.
- **Private APIs:** Use `Dynamic()` for runtime method dispatch. Touch objects use `NSClassFromString` + KVC to avoid designated initializer crashes.
- **NSWindow `isReleasedWhenClosed`:** Always set `window.isReleasedWhenClosed = false` for programmatically created windows managed by an `NSWindowController`. The default `true` causes `objc_release` crashes on dangling pointers during CA transaction commit.

### Shell Scripts

- Use `zsh` with `set -euo pipefail`.
- Scripts resolve their own directory via `${0:a:h}` or `$(cd "$(dirname "$0")" && pwd)`.

### Patchers

Every patcher is Swift, in `Sources/FirmwarePatcher`. The boot chain and kernel
run through `patch-firmware`; the CFW/DSC patchers are `vphone-cli cfw <verb>`,
one verb per patch, driven by `scripts/cfw_install*.sh` only.

- Disassembly is Capstone via `ARM64Disassembler` (the `libcapstone-spm` package). Assembly is `ARM64Encoder` plus the pre-encoded constants in `ARM64` (`ARM64Constants.swift`) — together they replace keystone's `asm()` / `asm_at()`, and `ARM64.nop` / `ARM64.movW0_0` are the old `NOP` / `MOV_W0_0`. IM4P containers go through `IM4PHandler` (the `libimg4-spm` package), which replaces pyimg4. Both resolve by URL; there is no `vendor/` directory to check out first.
- Dynamic pattern finding (string anchors, ADRP+ADD xrefs, BL frequency) — no hardcoded offsets.
- Each patch logged with offset and before/after state.
- No interpreter, no Python environment, no native-library repair: `scripts/build.sh` builds the complete app.

### Python

There is none, and adding any is a regression.

- No `.py` file is tracked in this repository, no shell script embeds a Python
  heredoc, and nothing resolves a `python3` at runtime. `git ls-files '*.py'`
  returns nothing; that is the standing check.
- There is no environment to activate and no dependency list to install. The
  restore backend was the last holdout and is now `Sources/VPhoneRestore` over
  two vendored C targets — see `research/restore/p2_restore_off_python.md`.
- A patch, a probe, a format reader or a device protocol belongs in Swift,
  where it is built, signed, gated by `scripts/check_aux.sh` and tested with
  everything else. Adding an interpreter back brings with it a provisioning
  step, a silent system-`python3` fallback, and a dependency closure
  `scripts/check_aux.sh` cannot see.
- There is no counter-example left. `amfidont` used to be cited as one — a
  third-party tool the user installed into their own Python — and it is gone
  too: the AMFI bypass is `Sources/VPhoneAMFIAllow`, one C file built by
  clang, and it needs no interpreter, no LLDB and no Xcode.

### Kernel patcher guardrails

- For kernel patchers, never hardcode file offsets, virtual addresses, or preassembled instruction bytes inside patch logic.
- All instruction matching must be derived from Capstone decode results (mnemonic / operands / control-flow), not exact operand-string text when a semantic operand check is possible. `ARM64Disassembler` is the only decoder — match on the decoded mnemonic and operand detail, never on a formatted operand string.
- All replacement instruction bytes must come from Keystone-backed helpers already used by the project: `ARM64Encoder.encode*` and the `ARM64` constants, which were generated by keystone-engine, verified by Capstone round-trip, and are asserted word for word against keystone in `Tests/FirmwarePatcherTests/ARM64EncoderTests.swift`. Never write a literal instruction word at a patch site. A new instruction means a new encoder plus its keystone-checked test case, not a raw `Data`. Keystone is deliberately **not** a project dependency any more — nothing at runtime or in the test suite calls it, and the expected words are frozen constants. To derive a new one, stand keystone up in a throwaway environment **outside this repository** (`brew install keystone`, plus `keystone-engine` in a scratch interpreter somewhere under `/tmp`) and run the one-liner in that test file's header against it. There is no dependency list here to add it to and no environment here to install it into; creating either is the regression the "Python" section above forbids. Do not invent an expected word without checking it.
- Prefer source-backed semantic anchors: in-image symbol lookup, string xrefs, local call-flow, and XNU correlation. Do not depend on repo-exported per-kernel symbol dumps at runtime.
- When retargeting a patch, write the reveal procedure and validation steps into the relevant research doc or commit notes before handing off for testing. Do not create `TODO.md`.
- For `patchBsdInitAuth` (`Kernel/JailbreakPatches/Storage/KernelJailbreakPatchBsdInitAuth.swift`, named `patch_bsd_init_auth` in the research docs) specifically, the allowed reveal flow is: recover `bsd_init` -> locate rootvp panic block -> find the unique in-function `call` -> `cbnz w0/x0, panic` -> `bl imageboot_needed` site -> patch the branch gate only.

## Build & Sign

The binary requires private entitlements for PV=3 virtualization. Always use `zsh scripts/build.sh` — never `swift build` alone, as the unsigned binary will fail at runtime.

## Design System

- **Audience:** Security researchers. Terminal-adjacent workflow.
- **Feel:** Research instrument — precise, informative, no decoration.
- **Palette:** Dark neutral (`#1a1a1a` bg), status green/amber/red/blue accents.
- **Typography:** System monospace (SF Mono / Menlo) for UI and log output.
- **Depth:** Flat with 1px borders (`#333333`). No shadows.
- **Spacing:** 8px base unit, 12px component padding, 16px section gaps.
