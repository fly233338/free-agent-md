# Copilot Instructions for Gitoxide

This repository contains `gitoxide` - a pure Rust implementation of Git. This document provides guidance for GitHub Copilot when working with this codebase.

## Project Overview

- **Language**: Rust (MSRV documented in gix/Cargo.toml)
- **Structure**: Cargo workspace with multiple crates (gix-\*, gitoxide-core, etc.)
- **Main crates**: `gix` (library entrypoint), `gitoxide` binary (CLI tools: `gix` and `ein`)
- **Purpose**: Provide a high-performance, safe Git implementation with both library and CLI interfaces

## Development Practices

### AI Agent Communication

- AI agents communicating through a person's account must identify themselves, for example in issue or PR descriptions and comments.
- AI assistance that does not replace the person as the speaker, such as proofreading or wording polish, does not require identification.
- Attributing AI assistance in commit metadata, for example with an `Assisted-by:` or `Co-authored-by:` trailer, is welcome but not required.

### Test-First Development

- Protect against regression and make implementing features easy
- Keep it practical - the Rust compiler handles mundane things
- Use git itself as reference implementation; run same tests against git where feasible
- Never use `.unwrap()` in production code, avoid it in tests in favor of `.expect()` or `?`. Use `gix_error::TestResult` for test functions and helpers.
- Use `.expect("why")` with context explaining why expectations should hold, but only if it's relevant to the test.

### Error Handling

- Handle all errors, never `unwrap()`
- Provide error chains making it easy to understand what went wrong
- Applications built on `gix` use `gix::Result` and `gix::Error`, preserving error context and source locations.
  Import error helpers, traits, and macros through `gix::error` instead of adding a separate `gix-error` dependency.

#### `gix-error` (preferred for plumbing crates)

Plumbing crates are migrating from `thiserror` enums to `gix-error`. Check whether a crate already
uses `gix-error` (look at its `Cargo.toml`); if it does, follow the patterns below. If it still uses
`thiserror`, keep using `thiserror` for consistency within that crate.

- **Public error APIs**: use `gix_error::Result<T>` and `gix_error::Error` for erased or
  message-based errors at public plumbing boundaries. Preserve concrete error types already exposed
  by public signatures, including `ExnResult<T, Specific>` and `Exn<Specific>`. This includes public
  traits, callbacks, iterator items, associated errors, and re-exported APIs.
  Keep native `io::Result`, standalone concrete-error results, and generic error adapters when they do
  not expose exceptions. This exemption covers native or operation-specific recovery errors, not
  shared diagnostics like `Message`. Public message-based errors use `Error` even without an `Exn`
  wrapper, including `FromStr::Err` and `TryFrom::Error`. Do not introduce public crate-specific or
  operation-specific forwarding aliases or renamed error exports.
- **Internal results**: use `Result<T>` for erased or message-based errors in private and
  `pub(crate)` helpers too. Retain concrete error types when callers benefit from typed recovery
  or payload access. Use `ExnResult<T, E>` or `ExnMessageResult<T>` when a specific exception type
  or exception-tree manipulation is actually needed; being private alone is not a reason to
  introduce an exception-returning wrapper. These aliases and typed construction helpers remain available.
- **Imports**: import `Result`, `ExnResult`, and `ExnMessageResult` under their canonical names
  directly from `gix_error` (or their `gix` re-exports), and use their bare names in signatures.
  Prefer to import `bail` when using `bail!`, via `use gix_error::bail;` or `use gix::error::bail;`,
  and invoke it without a qualified path.
- **Porcelain errors**: use the central `gix::Error` and `gix::Result` re-exports at public
  boundaries that return erased or message-based exceptions.
- **Static messages**: `gix_error::message("something failed")`
- **Formatted messages**: `gix_error::message!("failed to read {path}")`
- **Wrapping callee errors with context**: `.or_raise(|| message("context about what failed"))?`
- **Standalone error (no callee)**: use `bail!(error)` for an early return with a concrete
  error or message, such as `bail!(message("something went wrong"))`. For a result expression
  at a boundary returning `Result`, use `Err(error.raise())`.
- **Wrapping an `impl Error` with context**: `err.and_raise(message("context"))`
- **Typed exceptions**: use `.raise_typed()`, `.and_raise_typed(...)`, `.or_raise_typed(...)`, or
  `.ok_or_raise_typed(...)` when an `Exn<E>` is required; the default helpers return `Error` or `Result`.
- **Conversion without context**: `.or_error()` converts native errors and exceptions to `Result`.
  Propagate existing `Result` values directly when the callee already provides enough context.
- **Closure/callback bounds**: preserve concrete callback errors; use `Result<T>` for erased or
  message-based errors in public and private APIs. Private callbacks may use `ExnResult<T>`
  when they need exception-tree operations, or a specific error when useful. Use
  `.or_raise_erased(...)` to add context or `.or_erased()` to convert when an internal callback
  requires an erased exception.
- **`Exn<E>` does NOT implement `std::error::Error`** — this is by design.
  Convert with `?`, `.into()`, or `.into_error()` when a boundary returns `Error`. Conversion retains
  the original error types, causes, metadata, and locations; erased errors support downcasting for recovery.
- **In tests**: `gix_error::TestResult` (also re-exported by `gix_testtools`) accepts exceptions
  directly with `?`. Public `gix_error::Result` also works with `gix_testtools::Result` through `?`.
- **Common imports**: `use gix_error::{bail, message, ErrorExt, Result, ResultExt};` plus typed
  exception aliases as needed.
- See `gix-error/src/lib.rs` module docs for a full migration guide from `thiserror`

### Commit Messages

Follow "purposeful conventional commits" style:

- Write commit messages in Markdown and assume readers view them with syntax highlighting.
  - Enclose anything that occurs in code, as well as crate names and shell commands, in backticks.
  - Use Markdown generously whenever markup helps readers understand or navigate the prose.
  - Use the body to share everything known about what motivated the change, not merely what changed.
- Use conventional commit prefixes ONLY if message should appear in changelog
- Breaking changes MUST use `!` before the colon: `change!:`, `remove!:`, `rename!:`, or _scoped_ forms like `feat(gix-odb)!:`
- Features/fixes visible to users: `feat:`, `fix:`
- For a changelog-worthy commit touching multiple crates, _scope_ it to the crate that should receive the changelog entry, like `feat!(gix-ref)`.
- Refactors/chores: no prefix (don't affect users)
- Examples:
  - `feat: add Repository::foo() to do great things. (#234)`
  - `fix: don't panic when calling foo() in a bare repository. (#456)`
  - `change!: rename Foo to Bar. (#123)`
  - `feat(gix-odb)!: add a new object lookup API`
  - `fix(gix-ref)!: reject invalid reference names`

### Code Style

- Do not create persistent Python scripts in this repository. Use Bash for repository automation and script-based tests unless the user explicitly requests otherwise.
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Skip stylistic rewrites that increase SLOC after formatting; keep simpler existing forms instead of applying style rules unconditionally.
- Start new Rust modules as `foo.rs`. Create a module directory only when it contains multiple module files; then use `foo/mod.rs` rather than a sibling `foo.rs` file.
- No `.unwrap()` - use `.expect("context")` if you are sure this can't fail.
- Prefer references in plumbing crates to avoid expensive clones
- Avoid calling `.detach()` unless an owned value is explicitly required. Many `gix` APIs accept attached ids and references directly, so prefer keeping repository-backed handles like `gix::Id` when possible.
- Name variables holding untyped Git object IDs `<type>_id` or `*_<type>_id` (for example, `commit_id`, `root_tree_id`, or `note_blob_id`) so the object kind is always explicit.
- Use `gix_parallel::*` for interior mutability primitives

### Path Handling

- Paths are byte-oriented in git (even on Windows via MSYS2 abstraction)
- Use `gix::path::*` utilities to convert git paths (`BString`) to `OsStr`/`Path` or use custom types

## Building and Testing

### Quick Commands

- `just test` - Run all tests, clippy, journey tests, and try building docs
- `just check` - Build all code in suitable configurations
- `just clippy` - Run clippy on all crates
- `cargo test` - Run unit tests only

### Build Variants

- `cargo build --release` - Default build (big but pretty, ~2.5min)
- `cargo build --release --no-default-features --features lean` - Lean build (~1.5min)
- `cargo build --release --no-default-features --features small` - Minimal deps (~46s)

### Test Best Practices

- Tests must be isolated from the developer's checkout, other worktrees, shared
  Git metadata, and user configuration. Use disposable repositories provided by
  `gix-testtools`, such as `scripted_fixture_writable()`; never mutate a shared
  read-only fixture or use the source checkout as a test repository.
- Git invocations in test code must go through `gix_testtools::git()`,
  `git_command()`, or fixture scripts executed by `gix-testtools`. Do not spawn
  Git directly with `Command::new("git")` or ad hoc subprocess wrappers. If a test needs unsupported
  command options, extend the shared isolated helper instead of bypassing it.
  `run_git()` and `invoke_bash()` share this isolation. Subprocesses that invoke
  Git indirectly must use `gix_testtools::configure_git_environment()` too.
  Tests of APIs that read the process environment must isolate it before
  exercising those APIs or changing environment variables. In `#[serial]` tests,
  keep a `gix_testtools::isolate_git_environment()` guard alive for the entire test;
  it restores only its recorded changes on drop. Chain test-specific overrides
  onto that guard or use a separate `gix_testtools::Env` guard to restore them too.
  All concurrent environment access must participate in the same serialization. Otherwise, use
  `gix_testtools::run_in_isolated_process()` so changes cannot race other tests.
  Restore working-directory changes separately with `gix_testtools::set_current_dir()`.
- Setting a subprocess's working directory or passing `git -C` is not isolation:
  inherited `GIT_DIR`, `GIT_WORK_TREE`, `GIT_COMMON_DIR`, `GIT_INDEX_FILE`, or
  object-directory variables can redirect operations outside the fixture. Tests
  that exercise such overrides must scope them to disposable test repositories.
  Open repositories through the crate's isolated test helper or isolated `gix`
  options, with only test-specific configuration overrides.
- Run tests before making changes to understand existing issues
- Use `GIX_TEST_IGNORE_ARCHIVES=1` when testing on macOS/Windows
- Journey tests validate CLI behavior end-to-end
- Fixture scripts should document what behavior they exercise and what makes
  the fixture special. Leave clear-text breadcrumbs so future readers can tell
  which details are essential to the test. Use markdown doc-strings when available.
- Stabilize fixtures whose generated contents can vary by using the
  `_needs_archive` variants of functions in `gix-testtools`; these always use
  packaged archived fixtures instead of platform-local generated output.
- Use assertion descriptions to state what is being asserted. For `assert*!`
  macros this is the last parameter; for `insta::assert*` macros it is the
  second parameter. Prefer messages that explain the invariant, not just that an
  assertion failed.

## Architecture Decisions

### Plumbing vs Porcelain

- **Plumbing crates**: Low-level, take references, expose mutable parts as arguments
- **Porcelain (gix)**: High-level, convenient, may clone Repository for user convenience
- Platforms: cheap to create, keep reference to Repository
- Caches: more expensive, clone `Repository` or free of lifetimes

### Options vs Context

- Use `Options` for branching behavior configuration (can be defaulted)
- Use `Context` for data required for operation (cannot be defaulted)

## Crate Organization

### Common Crates

- `gix`: Main library entrypoint (porcelain)
- `gix-object`, `gix-ref`, `gix-config`: Core git data structures
- `gix-odb`, `gix-pack`: Object database and pack handling
- `gix-diff`, `gix-merge`, `gix-status`: Operations
- `gitoxide-core`: Shared CLI functionality

## Documentation

- High-level docs: README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, DEVELOPMENT.md
- Crate status: crate-status.md
- Stability guide: STABILITY.md
- Always update docs if directly related to code changes

## CI and Releases

- Ubuntu-latest git version is the compatibility target
- `cargo smart-release` for releases (driven by commit messages)
- Every commit must be self-contained and pass CI independently
   - Feel free to run `etc/scripts/ci-check-local.sh --thorough` until it passes as proxy, as running every commit against CI isn't feasible.
- Keep breaking changes and all adaptations required to build and test the workspace in the same commit
- When such a commit touches multiple crates, _scope_ its conventional commit message to the crate whose changelog should receive the entry

## When Suggesting Changes

1. Understand the plumbing vs porcelain distinction
2. Check existing patterns in similar crates
3. Follow error handling conventions strictly
4. Ensure changes work with feature flags (small, lean, max, max-pure)
5. Consider impact on both library and CLI users
6. Test against real git repositories when possible
