## Game bug reports

Users report game bugs with Lichii logs (`eden_log.txt`, `eden_log.txt.old`). Each `Booting game: <program id>` line starts a session; the build is on the first line (`Lichii Version: ... | nx2-<sha>`). Known program ids:

## Before writing a fix

Lichii is a fork of [Eglantine](https://github.com/Djihads80/Eglantine). Do not guess, and do not rewrite a fix upstream already has.

1. `git remote add upstream https://github.com/Djihads80/Eglantine.git && git fetch upstream`.
2. Check `upstream/nx2`, open and closed PRs, unmerged branches, and issues for the game and symptom (`gh pr list -R Djihads80/Eglantine --state all`, `gh issue list -R Djihads80/Eglantine --state all`, `gh pr diff <n>`). Read the diffs, not only the titles.
3. If nx2 is behind `upstream/nx2`, merge upstream first. Port an existing upstream fix before writing a new one, and cite its PR or commit.
4. Write a new fix only when nothing upstream addresses the root cause the log shows.

## Live debug server

Every debug package on the PC launches with `EDEN_NX2_DEBUG_SERVER=127.0.0.1:6545` (in the env argument of `build-fix.sh`; `EDEN_NX2_DEBUG_DIR=<dir>` moves its dumps). Ask the running game from bash on the PC with native Windows Python; MSYS `python` rejects `C:/` paths.

```sh
PY=/c/Users/Zortos/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python314/python.exe
$PY -I C:/lx/src/tools/nx2/debug_mcp.py --server 127.0.0.1:6545 --call '{"method":"status"}'
$PY -I C:/lx/src/tools/nx2/debug_mcp.py --server 127.0.0.1:6545 --call '{"method":"screenshot"}' --out C:/Users/Zortos/.capy/work/lichii-debug/shot.png
```

Methods: `status`, `frame_times` (`seconds`, `refresh_hz`), `screenshot`, `log_tail` (`after`, `contains`), `log_filter`, `capture_frame` (the frame dump below, taken now; `sampled`, `index`), `capture_image`, `reject_shaders` (`EDEN_NX2_REJECT_HASH` at runtime; `"reject": false` restores). Without `--call` the script is a stdio MCP server. See `docs/nx2/debug-mcp.md`.

- Try a live experiment (screenshot, `reject_shaders` A/B, `capture_frame`, `log_tail`) before asking the owner for a new build or shortcut.
- Use full 16-hex-digit hashes; shorter ones are refused.
- Restore every hash you reject before you finish.
- Never start or stop the emulator. If nothing listens, ask the owner to launch the game.
- Keep sessions light while the owner plays: one request at a time, no capture loops, `sampled` only when you need pass inputs.

## RenderDoc and the live server

Use both for graphics investigations. The live server provides emulator state, native shader hashes, logs and reversible shader A/B tests. [RenderDoc](https://github.com/baldurk/renderdoc) inspects the translated Vulkan frame: draw and dispatch state, resource contents, pixel history and shader debugging where supported. Prefer it over extending our dumps when it already exposes the missing evidence.

- Use the live server to identify the failing scene and programs, then capture one affected frame with RenderDoc. Find the first incorrect output and inspect its inputs, bindings, blend/depth state and resource dependencies. Record the build, settings, event IDs and shader hashes so the two views can be correlated.
- The existing integration is `src/core/tools/renderdoc.cpp`, gated by `enable_renderdoc_hotkey`. It requires RenderDoc to be loaded into the process; enabling the hotkey alone does not load it. Ask the owner to launch the capture-enabled package. Never start, stop or inject into their running emulator without their approval.
- [renderdoc-mcp](https://github.com/Linkingooo/renderdoc-mcp) is a third-party replay adapter, not part of RenderDoc. Pin and inspect its version, use a compatible RenderDoc Python module, and verify a real capture opens before relying on it. If an extension, pixel-history query or shader debug operation is unsupported, report that limit rather than treating missing data as a clean result.
- Keep `.rdc` captures on the owner's PC: they can contain game shaders, textures and buffers. Do not upload them to public issues or services. Share only the specific permitted evidence needed for the investigation.
- Capture and replay can alter timing or hide races. Compare with an uncaptured live run before ruling out a synchronization bug. Distinguish measured GPU counters from adapter estimates; use CPU/thread and frame traces for emulator performance.
- A shader replacement that reduces fog or exposure can be a useful visual comparison, but is not proof of an emulator fix. Trace the original pipeline's first incorrect result before shipping a change. Matching shader arithmetic alone does not validate bindings, synchronization or input data.

## Debugging tools

Use these before guessing. All are off unless the variable is set; pass them as the env argument of `build-fix.sh`. Read them from the log at `*:Info` unless noted.

| Symptom | Tool | Output |
|---|---|---|
| Wrong image (white, black, missing objects, smearing) | `EDEN_NX2_FRAME_DUMP=<dir>` with `EDEN_NX2_FRAME_DUMP_AT=<seconds>`, `<frame>f` or `file` (captures once `<dir>/capture.now` exists; default 60); add `EDEN_NX2_FRAME_DUMP_SAMPLED=1` for pass inputs | One frame's pass colour targets, dispatch storage images (3D included) and present source; with `_SAMPLED`, every texture each pass samples and each compute shader samples before its first dispatch (`kind: sampled`, with stage (5 = compute), TIC index, 3D and depth included) as `.png` and `.raw.zst`, plus `manifest.jsonl` with shader hashes, formats, addresses and per-channel stats. `python3 -I tools/nx2/frame_dump_index.py <dir>` builds `index.html`. Find the first pass whose output is wrong, then inspect its shaders. |
| Rejected or miscompiled shaders | `EDEN_NX2_SHADER_DUMP=<dir>` | Native programs with `.header.bin` sidecars and `failed-compute-*.env` for failed compute pipelines. Replay offline with `tools/nx2/shader_sweep.py` (see `tools/nx2/shader-sweep.md`). |
| A newly lowered program changes the image | `EDEN_NX2_REJECT_HASH=<hash>,...` (native program keys from shader dump file names, or shader hashes from the frame dump) | Those programs are rejected as if unsupported; the log shows `rejected by EDEN_NX2_REJECT_HASH` per hit. Bisect by halving the list. The key covers the captured code, so recompute it when the capture rules change. |
| Draw and render-state questions | `EDEN_NX2_RENDER_TRACE=1`, filter `*:Info HW.GPU:Debug Render.Vulkan:Debug Shader:Debug` | Per-draw state, rejected stages and zero-format texture descriptors. |
| Video playback | `EDEN_NX2_VDEC_TRACE=1`, `EDEN_NX2_VDEC_DUMP=<dir>` | Decoder submit, decode and composite trace; decoded frames. |
| Performance and frame pacing | `EDEN_NX2_GPU_PROFILE=1`, `EDEN_DKB_FRAME_TRACE=1` | GPU thread, back thread and Vulkan worker time per second by zone, GPU waits by the zone they happen in, waits for the back by site, and spin mutex contention; per-present interval, CPU and fence timing. The profile also logs `Async read-back per second` every 10 s: guest reads of GPU-written memory, their waits, and macro DMA reads that waited for the split's back or drained it. |
| HostTiming CPU or timer lateness (late guest timers, audio or vsync jitter) | `EDEN_NX2_HOSTTIMING_STATS=1`, or live with the debug server's `host_timing {"stats": true}` | One `HostTiming wait` line per second: waits, waits woken by newly scheduled events, OS sleep and `WaitFor` time (ms/s), how late timed waits ended and how late events fired (p50/p99/max µs), and the thread's CPU %. |
| Shader stutter or not, boot and cache costs | `EDEN_NX2_STUTTER_TRACE=1` | One `Nx2Stutter` line per frame presented over 33 ms after the last, with its top cause (gfx/compute pipeline built on the GPU thread, pipeline wait, shader capture, texture, buffer, query/fence, present, other) and each GPU thread's ms; `Nx2StutterSummary` every 10 s (frame-time histogram, builds, cache lookups, cache file size); `Nx2Boot` boot phases with commit and peak commit. Frames over `EDEN_NX2_STUTTER_DETAIL_MS` (default 50) also get `Nx2StutterDetail`: each GPU thread's eight largest zones (ms/calls) and the rare sites that ran (device memory allocate/free, staging, buffer and image create/delete/GC, synchronous downloads, `Scheduler::Finish`), with each run over 2 ms by thread; the summary adds the sites per 10 s. The category totals in the summary are every frame's steady cost, not hitch time. `python3 -I tools/nx2/cache_metrics.py parse <log>` turns a log into JSON, `compare` A/B runs; `tools/nx2/cache_bench.py` runs the cold/warm matrix on the PC. |
| Command corruption or pop-in | `EDEN_NX2_PB_CHECK=1`; A/B with `EDEN_NX2_PB_SNAPSHOT=0` or `EDEN_NX2_FETCH_DRAIN=1` | How many pushbuffer entries change between submit and parse. |
| Commands read from memory instead of their submit-time copy (frames ahead, #392) | `EDEN_NX2_LIVE_READ_CHECK=1` | Every 10000 such entries, `Entries parsed from memory (<reason>): N checked, M differ` per reason, plus the first four differing entries per reason. GPU-written pages differ by design (the GPU rewrote them after submit), so compare against a frames-ahead-0 run. |
| Split GPU thread races | `EDEN_NX2_SPLIT_CHECK=1` | Reports scheduler use from the wrong thread. |
| Wrong bytes where the guest reads GPU-written buffer memory | `EDEN_NX2_READ_CHECK=<n>` (1 checks every read download) | Compares 1 in n read downloads with a synchronous flush's copy. Every 10 s a `Read download check` line: bytes that differ, by who wrote them to guest memory, and GPU-modified bytes no download brought (both must stay 0). The first 16 differences get their own line. |
| Wrong macro parameters read by DMA on the split's front | `EDEN_NX2_DMA_READ_VERIFY=1` | A macro DMA read made without draining the split drains it anyway and is compared. Every 10 s a `Macro DMA read checks` line: reads, those made without a drain and those that read other words than after a drain (must stay 0), with the first 16 differing reads. |
| Upscaler and DLSS contracts | `EDEN_NX2_DLSS_CONTRACT_TRACE=1` | Inputs and outputs of replaced upscaler networks. |
| Service calls | `EDEN_NX2_IPC_TRACE=1` | IPC command trace. |
| Read stalls (loading hitches, NUP vs other containers) | `EDEN_NX2_FS_READ_TRACE=1` | About once a second while the guest reads, one `Guest storage reads` line (`IStorage`, the RomFS) and one `Guest file reads` line (`IFile`): count, MiB, p50/p99/max latency and reads over 1 ms and 16 ms, plus totals and read time since boot. Times cover the backend read (NUP decompression included), not the Switch 1 SD-card throttle. |
| Unmapped device reads (`Unmapped Device ReadBlock`) | `EDEN_NX2_READBLOCK_TRACE=1` | Every read of unmapped device memory, one line per read with its first unmapped address, unmapped byte count and caller (`file:line`). Without it only the first 16 are logged. |
| Device loss (`Device loss occurred!`) | Always on | The `Device fault` lines after it: what VK_EXT_device_fault reports (fault addresses and their type, vendor fault codes). `not supported by the driver` means the driver has no such data. |
| Out of memory (`Image ... failed: -2`, `No memory for the ... image`) | Always on | The `Memory trace` lines before the first failed image: system commit against its limit, DXGI local and non-local use, and each heap's driver usage and budget. On Windows, commit at its limit means RAM plus the page file ran out, not the card; other hosts report no commit limit and log `0 of 0`, which says nothing. The `Host memory:` line under `Texture cache thresholds` says whether host commit or the device budget bounds the cache. |
| Driver crash, stall or slow pipeline builds | `EDEN_NX2_PIPELINE_BUILD_TRACE=<file>` | A flushed `BEGIN`/`END` line per driver pipeline build with the pipeline and stage hashes; `END` adds the wall time (`ms=`). The last `BEGIN` without an `END` names the shaders the driver crashed or is stuck on. Times include waiting on other builds, so compare runs from the same cleared driver cache rather than single builds. |
| Host crash (log just stops) | Windows minidump in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\CrashDumps\lichii.exe.<pid>.dmp` | Read the exception and stack with the `minidump` Python package, then symbolize with `llvm-symbolizer --obj=lichii.exe --inlines --relative-address <offset>` next to the build's `lichii.pdb`. |

## How work is split

- One subagent per game, all running in parallel.
- Small research (upstream PR and issue surveys, log reading): a cheap model, DeepSeek V4.1 Flash at max reasoning when its endpoint is available.
- Hard fixes (emulation, shaders, GPU): GPT-6 Astra at high reasoning.
- When a GPT-6 Astra subagent can't find the cause, switch that subagent to Claude Opus 5.5 at high reasoning.
- The main thread (Opus) orchestrates and reviews.

## Builds

- Cloud machines build with clang and Ninja for compile and unit-test checks.
- The build the owner tests runs on the owner's Windows PC (DESKTOP-4UD89UT, Ryzen 9 5900X), built with clang using 12 jobs (`cmake --build <dir> --parallel 12`).
- On the PC the toolchain is clang-cl (LLVM 22) with the VS 2022 SDK, Qt 6.8.3 in `C:/lx/qt`, Ninja and sccache. Source is `C:/lx/src`, the persistent build dir is `C:/lx/build`, and `C:/lx/configure.sh` holds the configure flags. Build and package a fix with one command: `bash C:/lx/build-fix.sh <branch> <build-name> "<Game> - <fix>" ["ENV=VAL ..."] ["log filter"]`.
- Every fix gets its own debug build on that PC in `C:\Users\Zortos\.capy\work\lichii-debug\<build>\` and a desktop shortcut `Lichii Debug - <Game> - <fix>` that launches it with the owner's existing user data and keeps the log next to the build, so the owner can run it and send the log back.
- Bundle a round's candidate fixes into one build behind env switches, so the owner tests one package and A/Bs it live through the debug server instead of one build per idea.

## Toggles and merging

- Experiment switches (env flags that pick between candidate fixes) never merge to nx2. A proven fix ships as unconditional behaviour, and a disproven one is dropped.
- Diagnostic tools (frame dump, `EDEN_NX2_REJECT_HASH`, traces, the debug server) stay in nx2, off unless their variable is set.
