# CLAUDE.md

This is the deep-reference for working in this repo: the invariants, why each exists, and the
measurements behind them. It is loaded automatically by Claude Code.

**Contributors: start with `CONTRIBUTING.md`** — the short version (setup, boundaries, house rules,
testing habits). This file is what you reach for when you need to know *why* a rule is the way it
is, or you are changing a subsystem it describes. A change that other developers must know about
belongs in BOTH (see Conventions).

**PR text (title, description, comments, review responses) follows the `pr-writing` skill**: what
changed and why it matters, then how it was checked and what was not, then risks or follow-up when
there are any. Structure proportional to the change. `CONTRIBUTING.md` § Pull requests is the
human-facing half of the same rule.

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

**Node-based terminal manager** (BUSL-1.1, converts to MIT after 4 years — see `LICENSE`): multiple real terminals live on a single
pan/zoom canvas as draggable nodes. Target users are people with ADHD / disorganized
workflows who benefit from a spatial layout over stacked tabs. Long-term vision includes
remote access and paid features — the architecture is built so those slot in without a
UI rewrite (see Transport abstraction below).

## Platform support

macOS, Linux, and a browser Server Edition are the shipping targets; Windows is being brought up
as a first-class desktop target (extraction from external PR #276). The policy for what "supported"
means — and what you may assume when writing a feature — is three tiers, not "100% parity":

- **Core is first-class everywhere.** The terminal + agent + canvas + session-continuity
  experience must work on every desktop platform. Continuity is tmux on POSIX and, where there is
  no tmux (Windows), a standalone session-host process — the mechanism differs, the guarantee does
  not.
- **POSIX-bound edges degrade explicitly, never silently.** Some subsystems are structurally tied
  to POSIX (SSH ControlMaster, the unix-socket askpass transport, some tmux-only paths). On a
  platform where they cannot work they must either use a platform-appropriate mechanism or be
  clearly gated off — a feature that throws `EACCES`/`EPERM` on Windows because nobody checked is a
  bug, not an accepted limitation.
- **New code is platform-neutral by default.** Do not hardcode POSIX assumptions. Publish files
  through `renameAtomic`/`writeFileAtomic` (`src/core/fs-atomic.ts`), not a bare `fs.rename` — the
  guard test (`fs-atomic.guard.test.ts`) enforces this. Resolve path separators / absolute-path
  checks / file-link dialects against the filesystem-owning core's platform, not the viewer's, and
  never assume `/` or a unix socket. When a test can only run on one platform, gate it with
  `it.skipIf(process.platform === 'win32')` (or the inverse) and say why — never let it fail the
  cross-platform CI. The `windows-latest` CI job runs the platform-dependent suites on real Windows.
- **Line endings are decided by `.gitattributes` (`* text=auto eol=lf`), not by each contributor's
  git config.** Without it `text`/`eol` are unspecified and Git for Windows' default
  `core.autocrlf=true` gives every Windows clone CRLF working files — so a test that reads a
  checked-in file and slices on a `\n`-bearing literal (`CSS.indexOf('}\n}')`,
  `indexOf('\n}\n')`, `indexOf('\n}')`) matched nothing and failed on a checkout with ZERO local
  changes (issue #578). Two suites did; one reported 25 theme tokens missing that were all present,
  which reads like a regression rather than a broken slice. Attributes only apply on re-checkout
  (`git add --renormalize .` for a tree cloned earlier), so the readers ALSO normalize —
  `readFileSync(f, 'utf8').replace(/\r\n/g, '\n')` — and `src/shared/line-endings.guard.test.ts`
  fails on any such read that does not. `*.bat`/`*.cmd`/`*.ps1` are the deliberate exception and
  keep CRLF: cmd.exe is not reliably tolerant of LF, and those are the files a Windows contributor
  runs before anything else works.
- **PATH resolution and direct execution are separate on Windows.** `findInPathString` correctly
  follows `PATHEXT`, which means an npm-installed CLI may resolve to `<name>.cmd`; Node's
  `execFile`/`spawn` still cannot execute that path directly (`spawn EINVAL`). App-owned
  subprocesses must pass their resolved executable and argv through `directExecutableInvocation`
  (`src/core/exec-path.ts`), which invokes `.cmd` through a hidden `cmd.exe` with explicit escaping,
  verbatim arguments and delayed expansion off. Never replace this with `shell:true`: commit prompts
  and other user-controlled arguments would then be reinterpreted as shell syntax. The helper fails
  closed for `.bat`/`.ps1`, CR/LF/NUL inside argv, and command lines above cmd's real 8,191-character
  ceiling. stdin stays a byte stream directly into the shim; routing it through an npm `.ps1` shim's
  `$input | & node` text pipeline corrupts Unicode and line endings under Windows PowerShell 5.1.
  Interactive terminal agent launches keep using `agent-launch.ts`'s separately tested shell plan.

## Commands

**Direct Windows agent messaging:** `core/native-windows-pane.ts` owns a headless screen for
non-persistent native PTYs. Lookup uses the runtime node index, and the console identity probe
uses `GetConsoleProcessList` plus OS executable paths/birth times. A single process reached
through an unambiguous shell chain is required; detached or ambiguous candidates refuse. This
is not a POSIX foreground-process-group claim. **An interpreter (`node`, `bun`, `python`, …) is
named by its script, never by its own executable**: every npm-installed agent CLI on Windows is
`cmd` → `node <package>\bin\<cli>.js`, and naming that pane `node` made Codex and every npx
custom agent `not-agent`. The probe keeps only the interpreter's FIRST positional argument
(`CommandLineToArgvW`, inside PowerShell; the rest of the command line, prompt text included, never
leaves the probe) and `scriptCommandName` maps it to the key of its package's `bin` map, which is
the table npm generated the `.cmd` shim from, falling back to the script basename exactly as the
POSIX predicate does. The interpreter is the leaf, never a hop, so a CLI's own children (Codex's
native `codex.exe`, MCP servers) cannot make the pane ambiguous.
**A RELEASED session is still a messaging target.** Park expiry and the offscreen release drop the
`Session`, but the host keeps it running, so `targetLive` asks `PtyManager.sessionExists` (attached,
else tmux, else the host, with a failed read answering "exists") and the owner/paste/envelope probes
route through `sessionHostOwns`, which falls back to the release record. Asking only for an attached
client answered `targetGone`, terminal and never queued, about a live agent in another project. The project/verified-hook/idle/receipt gates still
apply, paste mode must be observed, and the exact generation/process is checked before writing.
`PtyManager.sendText` (the confirmed `write` verb, rename, note push, dictation) also routes a
direct native PTY through `NativeWindowsPane.sendText` — framed only when paste mode was requested,
no process attestation. It used to fall through to the session-host backend, which has no entry for
a direct PTY, so every `write` to such a pane failed.
Do not route the persistent session-host backend through this direct-PTY adapter. Its independently
versioned `messageOwnerV1` / `messagePasteReadyV1` / `messageEnvelopeV1` extension runs in the host:
the OS probe is bound to `HostSession.generation`, the session registry is rechecked after every
await, and the emulator's paste mode is checked again immediately before the synchronous write.
**The Enter is a SECOND write, sent only once the pane shows the envelope** — every backend
(Server Edition tmux, session host, direct PTY) runs the one `core/settled-submit.ts`. Measured on
the installed build (2026-09-14): with the `\r` in the same write as the paste, Codex rendered the
whole envelope in its composer and never submitted it, so the delivery reported `stalled`; a
separate Enter moments later sent it. A pane that never shows the envelope gets no Enter at all.
An older live host refuses these unknown commands while keeping the v1/v2 terminal contract intact;
never replace it automatically or fall back to name-only input to enable messaging. Windows OpenCode
context exports go through `directExecutableInvocation` like every other app-owned subprocess (see
Platform support), never a bare `execFile('opencode')`, which cannot execute the npm shim.

```bash
npm install        # deps + rebuilds node-pty against Electron's ABI (postinstall hook)
npm run dev        # dev mode with renderer HMR
npm run build      # production build into out/
npm start          # preview the production build (electron-vite preview)
npm run typecheck  # tsc for both node (main/preload) and web (renderer) projects
npm run rebuild    # re-run electron-rebuild for node-pty if you hit ABI/native errors
```

**`rebuild` and `postinstall` both run `scripts/patch-node-pty.mjs` first, and that is not
optional.** It carries TWO version-pinned native patches for node-pty 1.1.0, one per platform leg:
- **darwin** — `pty_posix_spawn` leaks a ptmx device on every SUCCESSFUL spawn (an off-by-one in
  the low-fd cleanup) and master+slave on every FAILED one; on this app's spawn churn that
  exhausts `kern.tty.ptmx_max` within hours, and terminals then simply stop opening
  (microsoft/node-pty#950). Rewrites `node_modules/node-pty/src/unix/pty.cc`.
- **Windows** — the native exit thread deletes its `pty_baton` without closing the HPCON the baton
  owns, so the session host's taskkill-first kill path (src/session-host/host.ts) leaves a
  host-parented conhost alive for the life of the long-lived session-host process, one per killed
  session, and `conpty.kill(id)` reports nothing. The patch serializes baton access, closes the
  exact HPCON before every baton deletion, and makes `kill(id)` return `true` only as positive
  proof — the contract `src/session-host/windows-conpty.ts` was ALREADY written against (it
  shipped with #305 expecting a patched node-pty that did not exist until this patch; do not
  wire `closeExactWindowsConpty` into the ordinary kill path — after taskkill the exit thread
  usually wins the race, has already closed the HPCON itself under the patch, and the primitive
  would then report `false`; it exists for a pre-first-output teardown that bypasses the exit
  thread). Rewrites `node_modules/node-pty/src/win/conpty.cc` on every host — the file only
  compiles for the win32 native target, so patching on mac/Linux is harmless and keeps packaged
  rebuilds honest.

Both patches run before electron-rebuild compiles the module.

`src/main/node-pty-patch.test.ts` asserts both markers are present in those sources, so a node-pty
upgrade that silently drops either patch fails loudly. **If that test is red, your `node_modules`
is unpatched, not your code** — run `npm run rebuild`. It deliberately does not measure descriptors
or handles (that is environment-dependent); it checks the source the native module is built from.
Upstream: the darwin leg tracks microsoft/node-pty#950; the Windows leg has no upstream issue yet.
When a leg's fix lands upstream, delete that leg (and the whole script + test once both are gone).
```
```

`npm test` runs the vitest suite (unit + integration; the remote e2e suites skip when the
companion server repo isn't checked out). `npm run typecheck` is the fastest correctness gate.

## Process model (Electron, three contexts)

The codebase is split by Electron process boundary — keep code on the correct side:

- **`src/main/`** — Node/Electron main process. The **shell** around `src/core/`: owns
  Electron/window/IPC wiring, dialogs, and the `CorePlatform` implementation
  (`platform-electron.ts`). The renderer must never import these.
- **`src/core/`** — Electron-free service core (pty, workspace/settings stores, git,
  hook server + hooks cluster, context/subagent tails, transcripts,
  model-window, license, context-link, and the pure ssh leaves under `src/core/remote-ssh/`
  — control-master, remote-git). Talks to its shell ONLY via the `CorePlatform` interface
  (`src/core/platform.ts`); importing `electron` (or `../main/*`) inside `src/core` is
  forbidden and enforced by `src/core/no-electron.test.ts`. The Electron implementation is
  `src/main/platform-electron.ts`. This is the seam the Server Edition's `src/server/` shell
  plugs into.
- **`src/server/`** — Server Edition shell (Phase 2): plain `node:http` + `ws`
  serve the built renderer to a browser and speak a WS-RPC protocol
  (`src/shared/rpc.ts`) that a browser-side `window.nodeTerminal` shim
  (`src/renderer/bridge/`) consumes. Boots the same core services via
  `ServerPlatform` (`src/server/platform-server.ts`). Single-user auth
  (scrypt + httpOnly cookie + Origin check). `npm run server:dev` to try;
  docs/SERVER.md for details. `src/server` must not import electron or
  `src/main` (enforced by `src/server/no-electron.test.ts`). **Phase 3a** also
  serves fs/git/commit handlers (editor/diff/source-control now work in the
  browser) plus a web folder/file picker (in-app server-directory browser,
  replacing the native dialog) and WS backpressure; the renderer detects the
  bridge in `src/renderer/main.tsx` (desktop preload path is untouched).
  The picker's **folder** mode also creates directories (`createPickerFolder`,
  `renderer/bridge/dialog-picker.tsx`) — the native dialog it replaces has a New Folder
  button, so without one "Open folder…" in the browser could only ever adopt a directory
  that already existed on the server. It writes through the same `fs.mkdir`/`fs.exists`
  the Explorer's "New Folder…" uses and validates the typed name with the same envelope,
  `newEntryPath` (`renderer/lib/explorerCreate.ts`) — **do not add a second path
  validator here**; `..`, absolute and empty names are refused in exactly one place. The
  write deps are optional, so a caller with a read-only fs simply renders no button. File
  mode has none (nobody opens a file picker to make a folder). Relay tabs get the same
  button and it writes on the HOST, like every other `fs.*` the picker already uses. SSH
  projects are a separate flow (`SshProjectDialog` over `sshProject.mkdir`) and already
  had their own.
  **Phase 3b** boots the loopback **hook server** (`hookServer.start()`) + installs
  the managed hook scripts, and `wireAgentStatus` (`src/server/agent-status.ts`)
  broadcasts `agent:status` / `agent:subagent-activity` / `context:update` over the
  bridge, so agent-status badges, subagent cards, and the context meter now work in the
  browser (transcript-path jailed against forged POSTs). It also serves the two transcript READ
  channels (`registerTranscriptIpc` — the ⌘M chat view + the find-bar's transcript index; see the
  ⌘M bullet under Agent support). **Canvas control is opt-in**
  (`NODETERM_SERVER_CANVAS_CONTROL=1` / `--canvas-control`): the Server shell installs its own shim
  and runs a serialized `HeadlessNodeFactory`; disabled remains the default. Its project writes
  broadcast on `workspace:server-change`, NOT the outside-edit channel — they are this core's own
  writes and are three-way merged by the renderer, never put behind the conflict bar (see the
  workspace-store bullet). (The SDK **chat node**
  — once listed here as deferred — was removed entirely, 2026-07; see the chat-node note in the
  node-kinds list.)
- **`src/preload/`** — the only bridge. `index.ts` uses `contextBridge` to expose a
  narrow API on `window.nodeTerminal` (typed in `index.d.ts`). `contextIsolation` is on,
  `nodeIntegration` off.
- **`src/renderer/`** — React UI. Talks to main *only* through `window.nodeTerminal`.
- **`src/shared/`** — types and IPC channel names imported by all three sides. `ipc.ts`
  is the single source of truth for channel strings; never hardcode a channel elsewhere.

PTY output flows main → renderer over per-session channels (`pty:data:<sessionId>`),
input flows renderer → main over `pty:write`. node-pty is kept **external** in the bundle
(`externalizeDepsPlugin` in `electron.vite.config.ts`) because it's a native module.

## Key abstraction: TerminalTransport

This is the load-bearing design decision. The renderer depends only on the
`TerminalTransport` interface (`src/renderer/terminal/transport.ts`), never on IPC or
node-pty directly. The current implementation is `LocalTransport` (IPC → node-pty). A
future `RemoteTransport` (WebSocket to a remote agent) implements the same interface, so
remote access / paid tiers can be added without touching the canvas or terminal UI. When
adding terminal-session features, extend the interface — do not reach around it.

## State & persistence model

**React Flow is the single live source of truth** for nodes. There is intentionally no
separate store mirroring node state — earlier dual-source designs caused sync bugs.
`src/renderer/state/workspace.ts` holds only pure helpers: the color palette, the node
factories (`createTerminalNode`, `createSshTerminalNode`, `createAgentNode(agentId, …)`,
`createAccountLoginNode`, `createStickyNode`, `createGroupNode`, `createEditorNode`,
`createDiffNode`, `createVideoNode`, `createWebNode`, `createBrowserNode`, `createFilesNode`,
`createDinoNode`, `createTriggerNode`), the
group transforms (`groupSelectedNodes`, `ungroupNodes`, `duplicateNode`), and the
`nodeStatesToFlow` / `flowToNodeStates` serializers. Node kinds (`NodeKind` in
`src/shared/types.ts`): `terminal | sticky | group | editor | diff | video | web | browser |
files | subagent | loop | dino | trigger` — `subagent` and `loop` are render-only (ephemeral hook-driven
viz) and never persisted. `trigger` (issue #493, all four
phases landed) is a first-class PERSISTED kind. The whole host-side
machine is composed ONCE in `core/trigger-service.ts` (`startTriggerService`) and booted
identically by BOTH shells: `core/trigger-scheduler.ts` (sweep-service shape, no catch-up for
missed slots, cron via the dependency-free `@shared/cron` with the vixie dom/dow OR rule) decides
WHEN, and `core/trigger-delivery.ts` decides WHETHER — the `sendText` paste path, an agent target
only on a mirror-verified idle `done` (busy/blocked/unknown → the messaging `DeliveryQueue`, own
instance, flushed by the mirror's `done` edge via `onNodeStateChange`, with FULL flush-time
re-validation: a trigger disarmed or spec-edited while queued is dropped), a plain-terminal target
only into a SHELL pane and never queued, a dead target an honest `missed` and never a cold start.
Fire-time `TriggerArmStore.isArmed` re-ask everywhere; every rule test-pinned. The kind's spec: its spec (`CanvasNodeState.trigger`,
@shared/trigger) is git-shared CONTENT sanitized as hostile input on every load path
(`sanitizeNodeTriggers`), and the definition alone never fires — execution consent is the
machine-local, content-bound `core/trigger-arm-store.ts` (a spec that arrives or CHANGES via git
reads as disarmed until armed on this machine). A node's `data`
carries `title, color, group, tags, collapsed, expandedHeight, shell, cwd, text,
initialCommand, filePath, diffStaged`, `icon` (a user-chosen emoji or picture — see **Node icons**
below), `agentId` (which agent CLI a terminal node runs —
persisted), and `accountId` (which managed Claude account a terminal node runs under — resolved
at creation, changed ONLY by the explicit account-switch actions, persisted; see **Managed Claude accounts**). `nodeStatesToFlow` defaults a
missing `kind` to `terminal` for backward compat and migrates the legacy `tags:['claude']` marker
to `data.agentId = 'claude'`. The SDK **chat node** was removed (2026-07); `nodeStatesToFlow` also
migrates a persisted `chat` node into a **sticky tombstone** in place, reading its legacy
`chatSessionId` to print a `claude --resume <id>` hint (a chat is an ordinary resumable Claude
session).

Persistence has two layers:

- **Layout + config**: schema v3. `workspace.json` (in `app.getPath('userData')`) is now an
  **index**: local folder projects are refs to `<cwd>/.nodeterm/project.json` (the source of
  truth — git-shareable, machine-portable; pretty-printed, portable `./` node cwds, monotonic
  `rev`), SSH projects are refs to the same file on the server (offline `cache` in the index,
  reconciled by rev on connect, mirrored via `SshFs` with a 5 s write throttle), and cwd-less
  canvases are refs to `userData/inline-projects/<id>.json`. **Every entry is a ref — one shape,
  three kinds:**

  | kind | source of truth for the CONTENT | what the index entry carries |
  |---|---|---|
  | folder-ref | `<cwd>/.nodeterm/project.json` (git-shared) | `cwd` + header + machine-local half |
  | ssh-ref | the same file on the host | `ssh` + header + `cache` (offline copy, rev-reconciled) |
  | local-data-ref | `userData/inline-projects/<id>.json` | `dataFile` + header + `project` (cache) |

  In all three the file carries CONTENT and the entry carries the machine-local half — project
  `id`, `viewport`, `defaultAccountId`, `breadcrumbs`, `closedSessions`, `localApprovalId`,
  `localExec`, `localSettings` (the #510 rule). The renderer contract is untouched: `workspace.load()/save()` still
  speak an assembled v2-shaped `Workspace`; all fan-out lives in `core/workspace-store.ts` +
  pure `core/workspace-files.ts`. v2 files migrate on first save (backup `workspace.v2.bak`,
  one-time renderer note). Outside edits (git pull/sync) are detected by
  `core/workspace-watcher.ts` → silent reload, or a Reload/Keep-mine conflict bar when dirty; they
  ride `workspace:external-change`, and so do the phone's `appendRemoteNode` and the SSH
  reconcile, which really are "another device".
  **A write this core made ITSELF rides `workspace:server-change` instead** — today that is Server
  Edition headless canvas control (`server/canvas-control.ts`) — and the renderer three-way merges
  it against the store baseline (`renderer/lib/serverChange.ts`: incoming nodes adopted silently,
  ropes/bridges merged by id with server-added installed, server-removed dropped, local unsaved
  edits kept, dangling edges pruned), never a bar and never a reload. It used to share the
  outside-edit channel and that was a data-loss path, not a cosmetic one: `decideExternalChange`
  compares the project shell, `ropes` included, so the one `ctrl-…` rope an `open-agent` appends
  read as a conflict whenever the canvas was dirty — which it is throughout a spawn burst (the
  paired `canvas:mut` marks it, spawns land 60–140 ms apart inside the 800 ms autosave debounce,
  and **the bar itself suspends autosave**, so once raised it stayed raised). Answering "Keep my
  version" then wrote the browser's edge state over the file, dropping the ropes the server had
  just persisted and resurrecting cards it had removed.
  Unreadable refs render as greyed **unavailable** tabs (never dropped); corrupt project files
  are set aside as `project.json.corrupt-<ts>`. "Open folder…" adopts an existing
  `.nodeterm/project.json` — the probe MINTS the project id (node ids — tmux names — kept), and
  re-opening the folder is answered by the cwd lookup, not a second adoption.
  **A cwd-less canvas is a supported, first-class project, not a degraded one** — "New project" on
  the welcome screen creates exactly that, and it survives a restart intact. It is the correct
  fallback layer and `localStorage` is not: `userData` is backed up with the app's data,
  atomic-written, and one store for all three shells, while localStorage is renderer-origin state
  the Server Edition would shard per browser profile.
  **What it used to lack was a SECOND copy, and that is what `local-data-ref` fixes.** A folder
  project's canvas also lives in `<cwd>/.nodeterm/project.json`, so a corrupt or clobbered index
  costs it nothing; an inline canvas existed ONLY inside the index — one file, last-writer-wins, so
  a second instance sharing that `userData` erased canvases that existed nowhere else, and a corrupt
  index left them only inside the `workspace.json.corrupt-<ts>` sideline with no UI path back.
  Each now has its own atomically written file, and the entry's `project` field is kept beside it as
  a **cache** — the dual-write that (a) lets a build older than this one still read the canvas out
  of the index (the downgrade contract, ONE release; the iOS SSH-browse path cats `workspace.json`
  directly and depends on it too) and (b) answers when the data file is missing or corrupt.
  The file wins whenever it reads. Rules that make this safe, all in `WorkspaceStore.writeDataFile`:
  an unchanged candidate is not written at all; **a lower `rev` may not overwrite a higher one** (a
  second instance wrote it after we looked — its canvas stands, the next load here adopts it, and
  there is deliberately NO merge: the guarantee is "two instances cannot erase each other", not
  "two instances stay in sync"); an empty candidate never overwrites a populated file this store has
  not read. A corrupt data file is set aside as `.corrupt-<ts>` like any other project file, and the
  sweep that deletes a removed project's file only ever touches ids THIS store had loaded — a file
  belonging to another instance is never deleted, at the price of some litter after a re-key.
  `userData/inline-projects` is deliberately NOT watched (`workspace-watcher` covers folder refs
  only): nothing external edits it — no git pull, no teammate — and the rev rule is the whole
  concurrency story. The corrupt-index note still matters and must stay honest; it used to promise
  "No project data was lost — each project's canvas is still in its own folder", which was true for
  refs and false for exactly the projects that had just vanished.
  **Binding a folder to an existing project is a WRITE, so probe before you bind.** "Set folder…"
  (tab ⌄) promotes an inline canvas to a ref, and the next autosave writes that folder's
  `project.json` — over whatever was already there. It used to bind unconditionally, so pointing a
  scratch project at a repo whose canvas a teammate had committed replaced it (rev 40 → rev 1, their
  nodes gone, no sideline copy, nothing on screen). The two entrances to "attach a folder" now agree:
  `openOrAdoptFolder` probes and ADOPTS, and `setProjectFolder` runs the pure
  `renderer/lib/setProjectFolder.ts` — an occupied OR unreadable `project.json` refuses the bind with
  its reason (a failed read is never evidence of absence, #385), and a folder another project already
  owns routes to that project, REOPENING it when it is closed rather than switching to a hidden tab.
  The store's own "never blind-write" guard does not cover this: it only refuses an EMPTY candidate
  over a populated file, and this candidate has nodes.
  **Features that need a folder degrade explicitly, never silently.** Explorer, Source Control and
  Project Settings already say so in words; the add menus now do too — "New file…" and "New
  worktree…" stay in the list DISABLED with `NEW_FILE_NO_CWD_HINT` / `WORKTREE_NO_CWD_HINT`
  (`lib/addMenuSpec`) instead of vanishing, and `openWorktreeDialog` refuses a cwd-less project at
  the same choke point it refuses an SSH one (the palette has no disabled state). The worktree
  dialog's "This project is not a git repository." was the wrong cause for a project that has no
  folder to be a repository at all.
  **An `unavailable` placeholder used to be a DEAD END** (issue #385): a save deliberately emits a
  header-only ref for it and never a file, so a `project.json` the user deleted was never
  recreated, every later load re-minted the placeholder, and nothing cleared the flag for a LOCAL
  project (`reopenProject` clears only `closed`; the sole `setProjectUnavailable(id,false)` caller
  is the relay reconnect). The tab went inert (`tabClickAction` → `'ignore'`) while the sessions
  sidebar — which has no concept of `unavailable` — still switched to it. An explicit "Open
  folder…" now breaks the loop, but only on EVIDENCE: `WorkspaceStore.projectFileState` reports
  `present | absent | unreadable` and **only a definite ENOENT counts as absence**, because
  clearing the flag lets the next save write the placeholder's empty canvas over whatever is
  there. Absent ⇒ clear; present ⇒ re-probe and rehydrate under the EXISTING entry id (a corrupt
  file stats fine, so a null probe keeps the placeholder); unreadable ⇒ change nothing. The
  decision is the pure `unavailableRecovery` (`renderer/lib/projectOpen.ts`), and it refuses to
  judge a REMOTE project from a local stat.
  **The shared file carries content, not identity**: no project `id`, no `viewport`, no
  `defaultAccountId` — those are machine-local and ride the index entry (`IndexEntryV3`), beside
  `localApprovalId`/`localExec`. Two folders holding the same committed canvas (worktree, branch
  checkout) are two independent projects, and the committed file is byte-identical on every
  machine. The file still carries a machine-INDEPENDENT legacy `id` (`legacyFileId`, derived from
  the canvas name) for one release, because a pre-change build sidelines an id-less file to
  `.corrupt-<ts>` inside the user's repo; it is ignored on read. Residual: node ids are still
  shared, so two worktrees still attach the same tmux sessions.
  **SSH mirror safety** (the ".nodeterm reset itself" bug — 12 fresh project ids and 45 orphaned
  tmux sessions in one field report): remote writes are atomic (`cat > f.tmp && mv`, `sshWriteArgs`);
  a mirror is never blind-written before the entry has read-compared the server file once
  (`WorkspaceStore.reconcileSsh` — the single decider; a checked read's `error` ≠ `absent`, and on
  error it decides NOTHING); cross-lineage conflicts (re-added folder, second machine, git checkout:
  the server file carries a different project id) are settled by content, not rev alone — an empty
  side never beats a populated one, adoption re-keys the file to the local project id (node ids =
  tmux session names are kept so terminals reattach), and a push outbids the losing lineage's rev;
  a throttled trailing write that drops after its optimistic ack re-owes the mirror
  (`markUnmirrored`); pending mirrors are flushed before the ControlMasters die at quit; and the
  SSH dialog **dedupes by endpoint+remoteCwd** (`openSshProject`, same contract as
  `openFolderProject`) instead of minting a fresh empty project for a folder that already has one.
  **The reconciler also recognizes its own writes** (the SSH twin of the watcher's `isSelfWrite`):
  the 15 s poll and the connect-time refresh read the very file the mirror writes, so
  `recentMirrorHashes` remembers the last few payloads handed to `remoteIO.write` and a read that
  returns those exact bytes decides "nothing new" — never an adopt/broadcast (which raised the
  Reload/Keep-mine conflict bar over the store's own autosave), and never a rescue of an OLDER own
  write still sitting under the 5 s throttle (which resurrected just-deleted nodes). Exact bytes
  only, so a phone append or another machine's save still reads as external. And
  `refreshSshProject` runs ON `saveChain`: off the chain a poll snapshotting the pre-save entry
  could complete its slow ssh read after the save's mirror landed and "adopt" the store's own
  write on rev alone.
  **A write ACK is not evidence about the server's CONTENT — only a read is** (2026-09-06 field
  report: 16 terminals deleted on an SSH project came straight back, announced as sessions
  registered from a phone the reporter does not own). `clearedNodes` is the tombstone set that
  tells the mirror's re-read "we deleted this, do not rescue it back", and it used to be dropped
  the moment `remoteIO.write` returned true. That ack is **optimistic for the 5 s throttle's
  trailing write** (`makeRemoteWorkspaceIO` returns true and schedules the run) — so when the
  connection died inside the window, `markUnmirrored` re-owed the mirror (`unmirrored.add`) while
  the tombstones were already gone, and the retry's re-read found every just-deleted node still on
  the server with nothing left to filter with: `rescueRemoteNodes` merged all 16 back into the
  cache, bumped the rev and broadcast them as an external change. The asymmetry was in one place —
  `unmirrored` was restored, `clearedNodes` was not. A tombstone is now retired ONLY by
  `confirmClearedDeletions`: a read that no longer lists the id (taken from reads the store already
  makes — the mirror's own re-read and `reconcileSsh` — so it costs no round-trip), or an adopt,
  which overrules our deletions outright. **Both** read sites must call it; wiring one leaves the
  other's tombstones alive for the whole run. The cost is that GC lags a landed write by one read,
  which only prolongs the suppression of a rescue we do not want; the benefit is that the rule no
  longer depends on a dropped write being REPORTED. Symmetrically restoring the set inside
  `markUnmirrored` was the smaller diff and was rejected: it needs the same shadow state anyway,
  and it only closes the one failure path that happens to report back. The set is runtime-only,
  bounded by the ids deleted this run, and pruned for projects that leave the index.
  **Neither surface may name a device for an adopted node** (`adoptedClause`,
  `renderer/lib/externalChange.ts`): nothing at that layer knows the source — a stale own mirror
  and a phone append are indistinguishable there — so the copy names the project FILE and offers
  the possibilities without asserting one.
- **Live terminal sessions** (tmux): terminals continue where they left off across node
  remounts *and* full app restarts, including running processes. See below.

**Autosave does no unchanged work** (`WorkspaceStore.save`): the parse of each `lastWritten` value is cached per raw string, and `workspace.json` is not rewritten when its bytes equal the store's last write AND the file still has the size+mtime+inode that write left — so another instance's rewrite is still answered (the inode catches a same-size rewrite on a coarse-mtime filesystem: every writer publishes by rename), a store's first save and a v2 migration always write, and every other index writer of ours clears the record.

`settings.json` is a separate store (`core/settings-store.ts`, `state/settings.ts`).

## Projects (tabs)

Each project is one canvas/page; terminals and notes belong to a project. The `projects`
zustand store (`renderer/state/projects.ts`) holds project metadata + the *serialized* nodes
of all projects. **React Flow remains the single live source of truth for the *active*
project's nodes only.** The contract:

- The active-project effect in `Canvas.tsx` (keyed on `activeProjectId`) loads that project's
  serialized nodes into React Flow. `loadingRef` suppresses dirty-marking during this load.
  A real switch applies the project's saved viewport; an **in-place reload**
  (`reloadActiveProject` — external file change / SSH reconcile) sets `preserveViewportRef` so
  the load **keeps the user's current camera** — the incoming file's viewport is wherever
  another machine last saved, and restoring it mid-work teleported the camera (most visibly
  right after a cross-project sidebar focus, when the connect-time SSH reconcile landed a
  second after fitView centered the node).
- **Project order = array order**, and it is ONE order shared by the tab bar and the sessions
  sidebar (the sidebar no longer hoists the active project to the top). Both surfaces reorder
  via drag-drop through `reorderProject(draggedId, beforeId|null)` (null = to the end; tab
  strip empty area and sidebar body are the end-drop zones), persisted like any node reorder.
  Sidebar disclosure is **persisted**, for group frames as well as projects:
  `settings.sidebarCollapsedItems` maps `project:<id>` / `project:<id>:group:<groupId>` → collapsed
  (`isGroupCollapsed`), and `settings.sidebarAutoCollapse` (default on) now only supplies the
  DEFAULT for a project row nobody has toggled (on = active expanded / others collapsed, off =
  everything expanded). **This deliberately replaced the old "a project switch resets every manual
  toggle" effect** (2026-08, with the nested sidebar tree): a tree the user shaped by hand should
  still be that shape after a restart, and one transient rule for projects plus a sticky one for
  frames would have been two contracts in one list. `projectHeadClickAction` is unchanged — an
  inactive project row switches, the active one toggles its own (now persisted) collapse — and
  every write **prunes** keys that no longer address a live project/frame (`pruneCollapsedItems` /
  `liveCollapseKeys`), because settings.json is forever and a canvas churns through group ids.
- The bottom-left **canvas lock** freezes the CAMERA only (pan/zoom): nodes stay draggable,
  resizable and connectable while locked — the point is "stop the map sliding", not "freeze
  the work". It is **transient by default and opt-in to remember**: a lock that survives a
  restart reads as "the app is frozen" to whoever opens the app next, and the lit button is a
  small thing to spot, so `settings.rememberCanvasLock` (Behavior, default OFF) is what turns it
  into a preference. The bit itself lives in localStorage (`nodeterm.canvasLocked`,
  `renderer/lib/canvasLock.ts`) beside the view mode and the explorer pin, never in settings.json
  and never in the git-shared `project.json`: the SETTING says whether to remember, the lock is
  one person's view state. Note the two tiers differ per surface: on Desktop both are
  machine-local, but in the **Server Edition** the setting rides that server's settings.json
  (shared by every browser hitting it) while the bit is per browser PROFILE, so two profiles can
  legitimately disagree about the lock. Desktop + Server Edition; **Mobile: N/A** (no canvas).
  It is one GLOBAL bit rather than per-project
  because `<Canvas />` is mounted once and is not keyed by project, so the lock always carried
  across project switches within a session. Restore is gated on settings HYDRATION (Canvas mounts
  first, so a `useState` initializer would read the default and the opt-in would silently never
  work) and latched to the first run, so switching the setting on mid-session never reaches into
  storage and locks a canvas somebody is working on.
- Before any project switch / add / delete, `commitActiveToStore()` serializes the live
  React Flow nodes back into the store, so nothing is lost. Then disk is written.
- Switching away unmounts the old project's `TerminalNode`s → their tmux clients detach but
  the sessions keep running; switching back reattaches. tmux session names are per-node-id
  (globally unique), so projects never collide.
- The tab caret menu's **Close project** (`closeProject`) is **non-destructive**: it sets
  `project.closed = true` (hidden from the tab bar, kept on disk with all nodes) and leaves the
  tmux sessions running, so closing just detaches like a project switch. Closed projects are
  reopenable from the **"Recently closed"** list on `WelcomeScreen` (`reopenProject` → restores
  nodes, which reattach warm or cold-restore). `hasProjects` counts only **open** projects, so
  closing the last open one shows the welcome screen. **Permanent** deletion (`deleteProject`:
  `transport.destroy(nodeId)` per terminal + drop agent status + SSH teardown) now only happens
  via the `×` on a "Recently closed" entry. **Closing now SAYS what it parks** (issue #442 —
  "close" read like cleanup while meaning "hide, and keep running"): a project with terminal
  nodes gets a confirm naming the count, with an opt-in **"end its sessions too"** checkbox
  (default OFF — parking stays the rule; checked flips the confirm to danger). The pure half is
  `renderer/lib/projectCloseSessions.ts`: **one definition of N** — the project's terminal-kind
  nodes, exactly the set the action addresses (`transport.destroy` is idempotent on a dead
  session), never a liveness-verified count that could disagree with the action; the END happens
  at confirm time against the re-resolved node set (agents spawn nodes on their own). A relay tab
  or a 0-terminal project closes silently (byte-identical old path). `endProjectSessions` mirrors
  `deleteProject`'s teardown EXCEPT it keeps agent status (the persisted sessionId is what lets a
  reopen cold-restore `--resume`) and never disconnects SSH masters (close never managed the
  connection). The `×` also confirms now, via `deleteConfirmCopy` — a relay tab gets "removes
  only this machine's view; reconnecting brings it back" with no danger styling (deleting the
  view is what turns the next connect into a first-connect re-adopt), local/SSH get the session
  count + "the folder (incl. .nodeterm/project.json) is not deleted". And "Recently closed" rows
  show a **live-session badge** (`closedSessionCounts` over ONE on-demand local
  `sessionMemory.read` per welcome-screen appearance — never a timer; `ok:false` ⇒ no badge,
  never "0"; an SSH project's host-side sessions are deliberately not claimed by the local
  count). Server Edition: all renderer-side; the ws-bridge `sessionMemory` is real, so badges
  describe the server machine; the `sshProject` legs only run for `project.ssh`, which that
  shell never has.
- **Closing a NODE keeps a pointer to its transcript** (issue #531). The per-project
  `closedSessions` ledger records the agent session id as `ClosedSessionEntry.sessionId`, captured
  at delete time from the live `agentStatus` entry — which that same delete drops, so this is the
  last instant it exists anywhere — falling back to the minted `node.agentSessionId`. It is a
  POINTER, never a copy: the `.jsonl` the agent CLI owns stays the only text, and a second store of
  transcript text would age, drift and need its own retention policy. The "Recently closed" row
  spends it on the **existing ⌘M reader** (`ChatPanel` in `readOnly` mode, hosted by
  `ClosedTranscriptDialog`), so resolution, the `{found}` vs empty distinction and Retry cannot
  drift from the live-node path. Two rules: it rides `IndexEntryV3.closedSessions` and is therefore
  **machine-local** — a session id is a `$HOME`-anchored fact about one person's machine, and
  `projectToFile` must never emit it — and it is **re-checked as a string** in
  `sanitizeLoadedClosedSessions`, because workspace.json is hand-editable and the value goes
  straight to a resolver. `closedTranscriptTarget` (pure) owns the refusals and NAMES each: a
  REMOTE session is refused (its transcript is on the host; locating it over the ControlMaster is
  separate work and must not hold the local fix hostage) and a pre-#531 entry says its id was never
  recorded. Only the "this was never an agent" refusal may render as nothing — for the others a
  vanished control would leave the user believing that closing destroyed the record, which is the
  belief this exists to correct.
- A project's `cwd` (folder picker, `dialog:select-folder`) is passed to terminal/Claude
  node factories so new terminals open there. **Folder ↔ project is deduped:** "Open folder…"
  reuses the existing project with that `cwd` (and its nodes) instead of creating a duplicate.

## Terminal session continuity (tmux)

`src/core/pty-manager.ts` runs each terminal inside a persistent tmux session
(`tmux new-session -A -D -s nt-<nodeId>`) on a dedicated socket (`-L node-terminal`) with
a generated config (`-f <userData>/tmux.conf`, so the user's `~/.tmux.conf` never
interferes; status bar off, **mouse on**, 50k history, `set-clipboard on` + `terminal-features
",*:clipboard"`, and the copy-mode mouse bindings). Because the tmux *server* outlives the app,
sessions survive when no client is attached. `src/shared/ssh.ts`'s `remoteTmuxConf` is the same
config for an SSH project's remote tmux.

**Every REMOTE tmux invocation starts with `remoteTmuxPathPrologue()`** (`shared/ssh.ts` — PATH
**append**: `/opt/homebrew/bin`, `/usr/local/bin`, `/opt/local/bin`, `$HOME/.local/bin`): an ssh
exec channel gets a non-login shell, and on a macOS host Homebrew's `shellenv` lives in
`~/.zprofile`, so a host whose own terminal runs tmux fine answered
`zsh:1: command not found: tmux` to every command of ours (issue #449 — the same class as the
remote claude probe's login-shell + PATH fix). Append, never prepend: a PATH that already resolves
tmux keeps exactly that binary, so nothing re-pairs a long-lived tmux server with a different
client build. When tmux is genuinely absent the interactive spawn (`tmuxOrExplain`,
`control-master.ts`) prints what is missing, how to install it and what a tmux-less remote loses,
then degrades to a plain login shell — mirroring the local plain-shell fallback; the raw
`command not found` line must never be the user-facing error again.

**tmux owns the mouse — scrolling, selection, and the alternate screen are all its job.** This is
the native behavior, and it is deliberate:
- **The wheel scrolls tmux's own history** (`history-limit`), not the emulator's buffer.
- **The pane is on the alternate screen** (`\e[?1049h`) — capabilities are NOT blanked — which is
  what keeps a full-screen TUI's input box *put* instead of scrolling away with the text.
- **Selection is tmux copy-mode.** A drag copies; apps that request mouse tracking themselves
  (vim, htop) still get their own mouse events — tmux forwards those regardless.

**Do not take scrolling away from tmux again.** A previous design did exactly that (`mouse off` +
`terminal-overrides ',*:smcup@:rmcup@:indn@'` to keep tmux on the *normal* screen, so its output
flowed into xterm's scrollback, which was then hydrated from `tmux capture-pane` on reattach). It
failed structurally: **tmux is a screen PAINTER, not a stream.** Every redraw (attach, resize,
refresh) erases and repaints, so blank and duplicated rows leaked into the emulator's scrollback —
users saw black bands and duplicated screens when scrolling up — and the pane stopped behaving
natively. The hydration that design needed is gone (see the reattach seeding below).

**Copy → the system clipboard, via OSC 52.** `set-clipboard on` **plus** `set -as terminal-features
",*:clipboard"`: on copy, tmux emits OSC 52 to the attached client, and the renderer's OSC 52
handler (`parseOsc52` in `terminal/osc52.ts`, applied in `TerminalNode.tsx`) writes the system
clipboard. Two traps, both measured on
tmux 3.4:
- **The `terminal-overrides ',xterm*:Ms=…'` entry does NOT work on tmux 3.2+** — with it, a copy
  emitted **zero** OSC 52 to the client. `terminal-features` is what actually enables the sequence.
  Do not "fix" the `Ms=` override back; it is why copying from SSH sessions never worked.
- **No `pbcopy` pipe.** The copy-mode bindings are bare `copy-pipe-and-cancel` (no command): piping
  to `pbcopy` was macOS-only, and over SSH it would have copied on the *remote* host anyway. OSC 52
  is cross-platform and works over SSH.

**A tmux client is not necessarily a watcher.** `SessionInfo.clients` is a COUNT
(`#{session_attached}`), never a boolean, because one session can hold several: the app's painter,
the user's own `tmux -L node-terminal attach`, a second nodeterm on the same socket, and our own
**control-mode shadows** (`PtyManager.shadowAttach`, used for background writes without spawning a
painter). The session reaper subtracts ours via the `shadowed` seam — a shadow is a real client but
not a watcher, so a shadowed session must stay exactly as cullable as an idle detached one.

The count is carried numerically rather than collapsed at parse time **because the subtraction
needs it**: a session holding our shadow AND a real client must still read as attached, and a
boolean could only be forced to false — reaping the session out from under whoever that other
client belongs to. **Any future reader of `list-clients` / `session_attached` owes the same
subtraction.**

Lifecycle, by intent:
- **Offscreen release (in place, 2026-08-11)** → a mounted node fully offscreen past
  `settings.offscreenTerminalMinutes` detaches its PTY client and disposes its xterm without
  unmounting (plate shown; tmux keeps running; reattach-redraw on approach, measured <500 ms).
  See the Terminal node lifecycle section for the two invariants (mount-stable observer;
  `session.source` remote gate). Note the released node is a DETACHED tmux session — it joins
  the session reaper's candidate pool (6 h grace still protects it).
- **Every memory lever must ask whether the kill ends live work** (`terminal/live-work.ts`). The
  renderer reclaims terminal memory in FOUR places — park window expiry, the park's LRU cap, the
  memory-pressure drop (all three in `park-budget.ts`) and the offscreen viewer release
  (`offscreen-policy.ts`) — and all four were written as if dropping a PTY client were free,
  because "the tmux session keeps running and re-attach redraws". **That sentence is only true
  where tmux is actually underneath.** On the plain-shell fallback (no tmux installed, tmux
  switched off in settings, or an install path `findTmux` missed) the pty IS the shell, so the
  identical call kills it and everything under it — an agent CLI mid-turn included. Issue #126: a
  project switch terminated a working Claude agent, which then auto-resumed from wherever the kill
  landed. The predicate is deliberately the narrowest one that closes it — a tmux-backed session is
  never protected (the kill costs a redraw), and neither is a plain terminal. **An IDLE agent CLI on
  a non-persistent pty IS protected** (`agentProcess`, `agentProcessInPane`; not once hibernated,
  paused, dropped, or once its CLI announced a SessionEnd, `sessionEnded`, which is its own
  transient flag because `state: undefined` alone is also what an idle agent looks like): killing it looked free because cold restore `--resume`s it on revive, but the
  resumed CLI fires `SessionStart:resume` and idles with no further hook event, the status mirror
  leaves it unverified, and agent messaging refused it for as long as it stayed idle — measured
  2026-09-13 on Windows native ptys. The mirror now also lets a verified `idle_prompt` right after a
  verified `SessionStart` commit a verified non-inferred `done` (`MirrorEntry.sessionStarted`), and
  the decider reports a proven node reset by a boundary as `targetNotIdleUnknown`, not
  `targetStatusStale`. **A fifth lever owes the same gate.**
  The fifth is the offscreen release of an ARMED node (`shouldDeferReleaseForHeldLaunch`):
  held launches now require the attached transport for echo verification, on every backend.
  Keep that transport until delivery or recovery; a blind paste by session name loses the
  shell-init repair and canonical-line protections.
- **Node unmount (project switch)** → the RENDERER **parks** the terminal (`TerminalNode.tsx`
  `parkedTerminals`): the xterm instance + its attached PTY stay alive with the `.xterm` element
  detached from the DOM, so a remount within the park window re-adopts them — instant, and
  exact (the tmux client never detaches, so mouse-tracking/alternate-screen modes and scrollback
  carry over; do NOT "optimize" this into a respawn+redraw — a fresh xterm on a reused client
  misses the attach-time mode sequences and breaks scrolling). The park timer then runs the real
  teardown: `kill()` detaches the PTY client; the tmux session keeps running. **Window and cap
  are settings (issue #886)**: `settings.terminalParkMinutes` (default **10**, raised from 5; **0 = until app quit** —
  `parkWindowMs` returns `null` and NO timer is armed, never `Infinity`, which `setTimeout` clamps
  to ~1 ms and would dispose every park at once) and `settings.terminalParkMax` (default **20**, raised from 12), both
  re-validated at park time. The LRU cap evicts **local parks before remote ones**
  (`planParkEviction`'s `isRemote`): a local re-adopt miss is a warm reattach in ms, an SSH one is
  a new client per terminal paced 4-per-master, plus a login if the master idled out
  (`ControlPersist`) — and a live parked client is also what keeps that master from idling out.
  Parking does not raise sshd `MaxSessions` pressure: masters are per project, so a parked SSH
  project holds exactly the channels it held while in view. Measured (headless xterm, 200×50): a
  parked tmux-backed terminal ≈ **2 MB** (alternate screen, empty normal buffer — tmux owns the
  history); a plain shell with a full 10k scrollback ≈ **27 MB**. WebGL contexts are
  **viewport-scoped and budgeted** (browsers cap ~16 live contexts, and a canvas holds far more
  terminals). A per-terminal `IntersectionObserver` (`rootMargin` pre-announces approach) only
  REPORTS visibility to a **module-level budget coordinator** (`terminal/webgl-budget.ts`) that owns
  every grant decision and all timing: it keeps the contexts WE hold at/under the live budget
  (`WEBGL_BUDGET` 12 default — the browser Server Edition; on DESKTOP main raises Chromium's cap
  itself via `--max-active-webgl-contexts` = 32 and boot raises the budget to 24 via
  `setWebglBudget`, constants in `src/shared/webgl.ts`) so
  the browser never has to **force-evict** — which is the bug that flashed Chromium's dead
  "lost context" placeholder (white box + sad-face) on a visible terminal during a fast pan / zoom
  out, because the old per-node observers each acquired independently and momentarily overshot the
  cap. Rules: a client granted only after an **acquire debounce** (`WEBGL_ACQUIRE_DEBOUNCE_MS`, so a
  pan-through never grabs a context for a two-frame flash); if granting would exceed the budget,
  **reclaim on demand from the least-recently-visible HIDDEN holder** (`hiddenAt` LRU order);
  if every holder is currently visible (zoomed way out), the newcomer is NOT granted and **stays on
  the DOM renderer** — we never push past the budget. A hidden holder keeps its context
  **indefinitely** (warm for a pan-back of any length) — there is no time-based release; it is
  reclaimed strictly on demand, either by a visible newcomer that needs its slot or by
  `releaseAllHiddenGrants` (queued through the drain) under memory pressure. `acquire()`
  returning false (WebGL2 unavailable) doesn't burn a slot; an externally-lost context
  (`onContextLoss`) is reported via `handle.contextLost()`, drops from the accounting, and — for a
  still-VISIBLE client — schedules ONE delayed budget-gated re-grant (sleep/wake GPU resets lose
  every context at once with no visibility change; without this every woken terminal sat on the
  DOM renderer until panned out and back). The NODE still never re-acquires itself (that loop is
  the eviction fight the design fears): the retry goes through `tryGrant` — never exceeds the
  budget, never reclaims a visible holder — and stops after `WEBGL_LOSS_STREAK_MAX` consecutive
  losses (visibility transition resets). The node registers via `registerWebglClient` on mount
  and `handle.dispose()`s on unmount (which releases + cancels timers). A parked terminal is
  off-screen so it holds no context. Permanent-delete paths call `disposeTerminalOnUnmount(id)` so a
  deleted node disposes instead of parking.
  **A renderer released while the node is unmeasurable mismeasures its own row spacing**
  (`terminal/dom-renderer-spacing.ts`): `WebglAddon.dispose()` is also the back-to-DOM-renderer
  path, and it runs from the lifecycle effect's CLEANUP — after React detached the element — so the
  fresh DOM renderer derives `letter-spacing` from a width cache whose `offsetWidth` is **0** and
  bakes in a whole extra cell per character. That is the "letters drift apart for a split second
  after a project switch": the adopting mount paints wide until the WebGL grant lands 150 ms later.
  Focus mode's `display:none` wrapper is the same shape. xterm re-derives the spacing on a char-size
  / dpr / options change and **not on a resize**, so nothing in the reattach path heals it —
  `applyFit` calls the change-gated `resyncDomRendererSpacing(term)`, which bails while the
  measurement is still 0 rather than re-baking the wrong number.
  **Which renderer a terminal uses** is `settings.terminalGpuRendering`, resolved by the single
  resolver `resolveTerminalRenderer(value)` (`src/shared/webgl.ts`) to `dom | webgl | shared`:
  `'off'` = xterm's DOM renderer, `'on'` = one budgeted WebGL context per terminal (everything the
  paragraph above describes), `'shared'` = **glyphgrid**, ONE canvas-wide WebGL2 context every
  terminal paints into (`src/renderer/glyphgrid/`, reached through `terminal/glyphgrid-attach.ts`;
  the per-terminal budget is OFF in this mode). `'auto'` (the default, and what legacy/unknown values
  fall back to) = **`webgl` on EVERY platform**, macOS included. The macOS branch has moved twice:
  it was `dom`, then `shared` on 2026-08-05 (per-terminal WebGL composited terminals black after
  zoom-out bursts, blamed on the OS compositor), and is now `webgl` — the blackout was root-caused
  not to context count but to a dependency skew (addon-webgl 0.19's dispose crashed on the 5.5 core
  and aborted its own DOM-renderer restore; pinned + healed, see
  `renderer/terminal/webgl-addon-pair.test.ts`). What actually guards macOS is a lower budget,
  `WEBGL_BUDGET_DESKTOP_MAC` (16, vs 24 elsewhere), capping compositor pressure at every zoom. The
  four-way setting stays as the escape hatch: `'shared'` is now opt-in only (also where the macOS
  default points back if the one unconfirmed 2026-07-30 whole-window-flicker report recurs), and
  `'off'` drops GPU rendering entirely.
- **Window close / app quit** → clients detach (`PtyManager.killAll()`); the tmux session keeps
  running. `killAll()` deliberately does NOT kill sessions.
- **Node reopen / app relaunch** (nothing parked) → a new PTY attaches to the same
  `nt-<nodeId>` session and tmux redraws current state.
- **User clicks ×** → `destroy(persistKey)` runs `tmux kill-session`, permanently ending it. For a
  REMOTE node it kills the remote session **and then the local one of the same name** — normally a
  no-op, but it reaps the orphan the pre-`requireRemote` local fallback below could leave behind.
  **Whether a node IS remote is answered WITHOUT a live session** (`core/remote-end.ts`,
  `planRemoteEnd`). `runEndSession` used to read it off the dying `Session` alone
  (`dying?.sshRemote`), and its comment claimed "both callers run while the session is still live"
  — which is false for the case that matters: a delete arrives precisely when there may be nothing
  attached (an app restart, the offscreen release, the 5-min park expiry, a project that is not
  even open). `dying` was then `undefined`, remoteness read as "local", the remote branch was
  skipped **in silence**, and the one kill that went out went to the LOCAL socket, where a
  `requireRemote` node has nothing at all. Everything else about the teardown ran, so the node left
  the canvas looking deleted while its `nt-<id>` kept running on the host — a leak with no surface
  anywhere. The durable answer is the machine-local index: the shell wires
  `PtyManager.setRemoteNodeOwner` to `workspaceStore.sshProjectIdForNode` + that project's
  ControlMaster (`refForProject`). A LIVE `sshRemote` still wins when there is one — it is the exact
  master the session was spawned over, and a node created seconds ago may not be in the index cache
  yet — so the two sources are complementary, not redundant. The Server Edition wires no resolver
  (it has no SSH-project manager) and its deletes stay on the local path unchanged.
  **And the kill is CHECKED.** The old `catch {}` read "remote session may not exist / master down;
  ignore", which are not the same fact: tmux's own exit 1 ("can't find session", `probeSaysAbsent`)
  is an ANSWER, while ssh's 255 / a 127 / a spawn error is a NON-answer with the session still
  running. A non-answer — and a node whose project has no master at all — is **recorded**
  (`core/pending-remote-kills.ts`, atomic JSON under userData, keyed by `user@host` because several
  projects share one host's tmux server) and settled the next time that host connects
  (`SshProjectManager.settleOwedKills`, hung on the shared connect attempt so the REUSE branch pays
  too; an entry is dropped only on tmux exit 0 or 1). The delete itself is **never refused** over an
  unreachable host: the node is going, and a refusal strands it on the canvas with the same session
  still running plus a dialog — the user answers that by deleting it again. That trade is only
  defensible BECAUSE the debt is durable; drop the store and refusing becomes the honest option.
  **Only a `delete` may owe a debt.** A `recycle` keeps the node (worktree move, model switch,
  "pause & end session"), so a kill deferred to a later reconnect would land on the session that
  node has since RESPAWNED under the same name — ending live work hours after the action that
  queued it, with nothing on screen connecting the two. A recycle still ATTEMPTS the remote kill;
  it just records nothing when it cannot land, exactly as before.
- **A remote node is NEVER spawned locally** (`PtyCreateOptions.requireRemote`). `sshRemote` says
  "here is the master to run over"; `requireRemote` says "and if there isn't one, spawn NOTHING".
  Without it, a create with no `sshRemote` falls through to core's local tmux/plain-shell branches
  — which is how an SSH project's terminal opened while the ControlMaster was down (no network,
  host unreachable, `ssh` missing) quietly became a LOCAL shell in the local `$HOME`: same node id,
  same `SSH user@host` header chip, the REMOTE session's scrollback snapshot replayed into it, and
  — for an agent node — a cold-restore `claude --resume <remote session id>` running on the wrong
  machine under the local account, leaving an orphaned local `nt-<id>` behind. Refused on both
  sides: the renderer never calls `create` when `resolveSshRemote` came back empty
  (`CoState.offline` + the node's Reconnect button), and core refuses in `spawnNew`
  (`PtyCreateResult.unavailable`) so a master that dies inside the round-trip can't sneak through.
  The refusal is **only** in `spawnNew` — a co-attach JOIN to a live session for that node id is
  still correct. An offline node reports itself to `SshReconnector`, so the canvas heals itself;
  `retryNow` (banner Reconnect / node Reconnect) skips the backoff and clears the refuse window.
- **A shared Codex daemon restart is NOT a terminal-session restart.** tmux survives, and the Codex
  rollout/thread survives, but every `codex --remote unix://` TUI attached to that account's one
  app-server socket exits together. `buildCodexLauncherScript` therefore stays in the pane as a
  bounded transport supervisor after binding a thread instead of `exec`ing the remote TUI. On an
  abnormal client exit it resumes that exact thread only when `app-server daemon version` no longer
  reports `status: running` or the known control-socket inode changed; the same healthy generation
  returns the original status so a deterministic CLI error cannot relaunch forever. A reconnect
  never replays the launch prompt/options (that would duplicate the user's turn), and three rapid
  resets stop with a manual `codex resume <thread>` receipt. Preflight probes live protocol health
  before lifecycle start: Codex's PID ownership record can go stale while the shared process remains
  responsive, and killing that "orphan" would fan one bookkeeping failure out across every node.
  The generated-shell tests run the replaced-socket, missing-daemon, healthy-client-error, and
  responsive-orphan cases under real `/bin/sh`; the healthy-error case is the mutation guard.
  **Both shells wire this spine.** Electron and Server Edition arm the same signed record secret,
  thread start/bind handlers, capability refresh, and UI identity events; the server composition is
  isolated in `server/codex-shared-identity.ts` and behavior-tested. The old Server Edition
  "deliberate plain Codex" answer bypassed the launcher entirely, so a reconnect implementation in
  the launcher could be perfectly green while every headless pane still fell back to its shell.
  **No approval override ever rides that remote resume** (issue #811). MEASURED on
  `codex-cli 0.154.0` against a real thread on a running shared app-server, under a pty:
  `codex --remote unix:// resume <thread> --ask-for-approval on-request` answers
  `Error: Permission overrides are not supported when resuming a remote task.` and exits 1 —
  `on-request` being that build's own default policy and a member of its enum, so this is **not**
  the missing `untrusted` of #785. The same command with the flag removed resumes and the TUI stays
  up, and `-c approval_policy=never` is refused identically: the rule is about the OVERRIDE, not
  about a value or a spelling, so there is no mapping of `manual`/`auto`/`bypassPermissions` that
  survives this path and nothing to decide. Since `withPermissionMode` appends the flag to every
  agent launch, every shared-identity Codex node died on its first turn at a bare shell.
  `nt_run_shared` therefore strips `--ask-for-approval`/`-a` (both the spaced and the `=` form)
  from the first-launch argv. **The strip is in the LAUNCHER, not in the TypeScript that builds the
  line, and that placement is the invariant**: every identity-setup failure above it ends in
  `exec codex "$@"` — plain codex, no `--remote` — where 0.154 still accepts the flag, so
  suppressing it one layer up would take the permission mode away from exactly the nodes that could
  not get a managed identity. The `else` branch has always resumed with no caller options at all,
  so this only makes the first launch agree with the recovery beside it; the cost on an older codex
  that still accepts the flag on a resume is that the mode is not applied on the managed path, which
  after the first daemon reset was already true. **There is deliberately no capability gate**: the
  refusal is a runtime check, absent from `--help`, so `codexCliSupportsRemote`'s shape does not
  transfer — and it fires AFTER the session lookup, so a throwaway thread id answers "no saved
  session" with or without the flag. Probing costs a real resumable thread, which is the thing being
  launched.
- **"Restart agent (resume)"** → deliberately NOT a session lifecycle event: `terminal/
  agent-restart.ts` restarts the agent CLI *inside* the pane and leaves the PTY, the tmux session
  and its scrollback untouched. It exists for **new-model pickup** — a freshly released model only
  shows up in a CLI's model list on a fresh launch, and doing that by hand means closing and
  re-resuming every agent node on the canvas. Choreography: write the CLI's own exit line (`/exit`
  for claude, `/quit` for codex — that table is also the gate, an agent not in it can never be
  restarted in place), poll `pty:pane-command` (`#{pane_current_command}`, local tmux socket or the
  project's SSH ControlMaster; any failure reads as "not a shell yet") every `RESTART_POLL_MS`
  (250 ms) until a SHELL owns the pane, then echo-deliver `resumeCommand(...)` — the same
  `claude --resume` / `codex resume` the cold restore uses. **Nothing is ever killed**: if the CLI
  has not quit within `RESTART_EXIT_TIMEOUT_MS` (6 s) the run reports `exit-timeout` and leaves the
  session running. **A user-asked restart gets a late window on top** (`RESTART_LATE_EXIT_MS`, 60 s,
  spent only while the pane still reads): issue #899 was a 19 h cron session whose CLI quit a moment
  AFTER the 6 s, with nothing left watching — the node sat at a bare shell with no agent and no
  resume. The Eco sweep and Pause keep the bare 6 s (the sweep is serialized canvas-wide). The
  exit-timeout notice (`exitTimeoutNotice`) hands over the bare resume line for exactly that
  late-quit case. A `working` **or `blocked`** session is refused — `/exit` typed into a
  permission prompt would ANSWER it, not quit — and a node is held one-restart-at-a-time until the
  resume line has actually LEFT the pane (an un-submitted line is where a second `/exit` would be
  spliced in). The bulk action runs the same per-node closure sequentially over every idle agent
  node in canvas order and reports one summary line. `performRestartResume` is now a COMPOSITION of
  `performExitPhase` + `performResumePhase` (2026-08-12, behavior-pinned split) — hibernation
  drives the halves separately; each half refuses independently.
- **Agent hibernation ("Eco", 2026-08-12, OPT-IN default off)** → `settings.agentHibernationEnabled`
  (+ `agentHibernationIdleMinutes`, default 30; Settings → Agents): a 60 s renderer sweep
  (`Canvas`) exits the CLI of up to **2** agent nodes per pass that are hook-idle in state `done`,
  fully offscreen (`isNodeWatched` — an open kanban card modal counts as watched), local, idle ≥
  window, non-recurring, without live subagents (`planHibernation` +
  `lib/hibernationCandidates.ts`, both pure/tested). tmux + shell survive; node shows a clickable
  SLEEPING chip; wake (view / chip / modal open) verifies a SHELL owns the pane
  (`isShellCommand` OR the persisted `hibernatedPane` the exit settled on — nu/pwsh users) before
  the KILL_LINE'd, echo-verified `withPermissionMode(resumeCommand(...))`. Sweep/wake/menu-restart
  share ONE `guardConcurrentRestart` set. Load-bearing rules a refactor must not undo:
  (1) **recurring fact is durable** — both loop-card dismiss surfaces route through
  `lib/loopCard.ts`, which HIDES a cron/schedule card but retains `agentStatus.loop`
  (`dismissed: true`); clearing it would let Eco `/exit` a CLI whose cron wakeup lives in that
  process. (2) **Fire-time re-asks**: still-offscreen, remote, eligibility — a plan-time verdict
  is stale by seconds. (3) `hibernated` **self-heals** on live hook states + SessionStart (never
  on `done` — a late Stop POST must not undo a just-performed hibernate); cold restore (`fresh`)
  clears `hibernated` UNCONDITIONALLY and normally lets auto-resume own the node — **`paused` (see
  below) is what makes that auto-resume itself conditional**, the one deliberate exception: the
  flag it gates is still cleared, only the relaunch is skipped. (4) **Ordering with offscreen
  release**:
  Eco defers the Phase-2 viewer release until the node hibernates (hard cap idle+offscreen), but
  ONLY when the idle clock is known (`idleKnown` — `lastEventAt` is transient, so after an app
  restart nothing can hibernate and deferring would make Eco a memory regression). Eco is
  structurally inert for sessions with no turn in the current app run — documented follow-up.
  The deferral is also unaware of `paused`: a deep-paused node's freshly recycled shell keeps its
  xterm alive until the hard cap, waiting for a hibernation that (being already exited, or having
  no CLI to exit) can never come — a second documented follow-up.
  Device checklist (8 items) in PR #130 — owed before recommending Eco to anyone.
- **"Pause session"** (manual, or via Eco when `settings.agentHibernationPersistAcrossRestart` is
  on) → `agentStatus.paused`, a persisted flag alongside `hibernated` with ONE job: stop a node
  from coming back on its own. Two depths, chosen per node: shallow — identical to an Eco exit
  (`registerAgentPause`'s `pause` closure reuses `performExitPhase`), plus `paused` — or "pause &
  end session" — the same recycle `restartAgentNode(…, restartShell: true)` uses
  (`transport.recycle` + a `respawnNonce` bump), so the node comes back `fresh` next time, with no
  live tmux session to hold memory. Two pure predicates in `terminal/hibernation-policy.ts` pin the
  contract: `shouldColdResume` (a `fresh` mount must not auto-relaunch a paused node — see Cold
  restore above) and `shouldAutoWake` (the mount-timer, visibility-edge, and kanban-card-modal-open
  auto-wake triggers must not fire for a paused node, hibernated or not — only an explicit Resume,
  which reuses the SAME `wakeHibernatedNode` trigger the SLEEPING/PAUSED chip's click uses, so it
  gets the same `WakeInputBuffer` splice protection and retry budget). Pausing an already-hibernated
  node skips the exit phase entirely (`alreadyExited` in the closure) — asking an idle CLI-less
  shell to quit would type `/exit` into it as a real command. `paused` is ALSO excluded from Eco's
  own candidate plan and its exit closure's fire-time re-ask (`HibernationCandidate.paused`,
  `hibernationCandidates.ts`) — a deep-paused node has `hibernated` unset (its tmux was recycled,
  not exited), so `!hibernated` alone would still admit it to a sweep whose dropped SessionEnd hook
  POST left a stale `done` behind: the same `/exit`-into-a-bare-shell mistake `alreadyExited` closes
  on the manual path, closed here on the automatic one. Node menu only today (canvas right-click +
  the sessions sidebar row menu, which shares the same `selectionItems` builder, plus a read-only
  kanban card badge and a clickable one in the card modal); no command palette entry.

The node id is the `persistKey` (passed to `transport.create`), so it must stay stable.
If tmux is unavailable, `PtyManager` falls back to a plain shell (no cross-restart
continuity). `findTmux()` resolves an absolute path because GUI apps don't inherit the
shell PATH, and it tries three sources **in this order: fixed system paths → the shell's
PATH → the tmux the macOS app SHIPS** (`bundledTmuxPath`). System first is deliberate — a
machine that already has tmux keeps using its own, so the bundled copy is a floor, never an
override. `resourcesPath` is `undefined` on the **Server Edition**, so the bundled binary is
unreachable there by construction; a Linux host is expected to have its own. Under
`electron-vite dev` the last candidate resolves against `process.cwd()`, which is where
`scripts/build-tmux.mjs` writes its artifact. If tmux is unavailable from all three,
`PtyManager` still falls back to a plain shell; `TMUX`/`TMUX_PANE` are stripped from the child env to avoid nesting refusal.

**A session-host session follows its most recently ACTIVE viewer, like tmux's `window-size
latest`** (issue #914). Under tmux a relay-mirrored phone is its own tmux client, so dismissing its
keyboard gives it its rows back; on the session host the phone and the desktop node share ONE
client socket, and the old componentwise minimum held the phone to the desktop node's rows with an
empty band and no explanation. `latestClaimSize` (`core/pty-size.ts`) picks the claim with the
highest recency — bumped by an attach, a claim that CHANGES, and a write that is not an emulator's
automatic answer (`core/terminal-reports.ts`; every attached xterm answers a DA/CPR/OSC query, and
counting those would hand the session to whoever answered last). Three rules, each load-bearing:
(1) a viewer that cannot adapt is a CEILING — a pty wider than the phone's screen would wrap into
garbage there (or, rendered at the pty's size, be clipped to its left ~45 columns), so a relay sink is
`bounding` unless `pty.attach` said `resizedFrames: true`. The iOS app deliberately does NOT send it:
it reads `OP.Resized` only to show a "Sized to another screen · Fit this screen" hint, and every
phone report is ANSWERED (the sink's `sinkShown` is forgotten on each report) because the phone
clears that hint whenever it sends a size; (2) the real size flows back to every viewer (`SessionHostPty.onSize` →
`PtyManager.applyBackendSize` → `pty:size`, and `OP.Resized` to the sink), and a session-host
`Session`'s `applySize` only VOTES; (3) the host's `geometry` push is NEGOTIATED at `hello`
(`SESSION_HOST_FEATURES`) and sent only to sockets that asked — an older client reads every
non-`data` push frame as an EXIT. Across app connections the host still takes the minimum. Full
write-up: `docs/windows-session-host.md` → "Output ordering, flow ownership, and geometry".

### Cold restore (machine reboot)

tmux only survives an **app** restart — a **machine reboot kills the tmux server**, so every
`nt-<nodeId>` session is gone. To bridge that, `create()` returns `PtyCreateResult` with a
`fresh` flag: it asks the tmux server whether the session already exists *before* spawning, so
`fresh=false` means a warm reattach (tmux redraws) and `fresh=true` means a cold start (first open
OR post-reboot). Locally that ask is one `tmux has-session` per node; **on an SSH project it is ONE
`tmux list-sessions` per host per burst** (`core/remote-ssh/remote-session-index.ts`), because a
project switch mounts every node in the same tick and N probe channels on top of N pty channels
overrun a stock host's `MaxSessions 10`. The measurement and the failure chain it closes are in
that module's header; the two rules a refactor must not undo are **(1)** only tmux's own exit 1 is
evidence of absence — every other outcome answers "exists", because a transport failure read as
"cold" replays a snapshot and types `claude --resume …` into a LIVE agent pane — and **(2)** a
session this process just spawned is recorded (`markPresent`) and a remote kill invalidates the
cached list, so nothing inside the cache window can be told it is cold when it is not. On a
cold start the renderer (`TerminalNode.tsx`) reconstructs state instead of relying on the dead
session (you can't keep a live OS process across a reboot):
- **Scrollback replay** — `core/scrollback-store.ts` keeps a byte-capped (`256 KB`) snapshot of
  each tmux session's recent output under `<userData>/terminal-scrollback/`, refreshed on a
  timer (`SCROLLBACK_SNAPSHOT_MS`) + on detach/quit (`tmux capture-pane -e`). On a cold start the
  renderer reads it via `pty.readScrollback` and writes it back into xterm (with a "session
  restored" separator). Warm reattach skips it (tmux already redraws). Deleted with the node in
  `destroySession`.
  **The periodic capture is paced, serialized and deduplicated** (`snapshotTick`,
  `core/scrollback-cadence.ts`). A working agent's spinner keeps its session dirty forever, so the
  old tick spawned a `capture-pane -S -1500` (an ssh exec for a remote node) and rewrote up to
  256 KB for EVERY busy session, all in the same instant, every 15 s. Now: a dirty session is
  captured on its first `BUSY_AFTER_TICKS` (4) consecutive dirty ticks, then every
  `BUSY_EVERY_TICKS`-th (60 s); an off-cadence tick KEEPS the dirty bit, which is what lets
  detach/quit still take their final capture; an idle tick resets the count. Captures run one at a
  time on `snapshotChain`, a session whose capture is still queued is never queued twice
  (`snapshotQueued`), and a failed capture OR a failed disk write re-marks it dirty
  (`writeScrollbackIfChanged` reports the write; a skipped unchanged capture counts as done). Every write (periodic, detach, quit)
  goes through `writeScrollbackIfChanged`, which skips a capture whose sha1 matches the last one
  written; the digest is dropped with the file in `endSession`, so a recreated node always writes.
  The cost is bounded and deliberate: a continuously busy session's post-reboot replay can be up to
  ~60 s stale, since the snapshot only serves a machine reboot.
- **Agent resume** — on a cold start of a node whose `agentId` is in `RESUMABLE_AGENTS`, the
  renderer re-launches the agent CLI: `resumeCommand(agentId, sessionId)` (from the session id
  persisted in `agentStatus` localStorage — `claude --resume`, `codex resume`, `gemini
  --resume`) when known, else the bare `launchCmd`. The one-shot `data.initialCommand` still wins
  on the very first open, so the agent is never double-launched. **The one exception: a `paused`
  node** (see "Pause session" below) skips this auto-relaunch — that is the entire point of the
  flag — and instead records the pane its fresh shell settled on (`agentStatus.hibernatedPane`),
  so a later explicit Resume can recognize it even for a default shell outside the wake's
  `isShellCommand` allowlist.
  **A persisted session id is not evidence the conversation still exists**, and a dead one is not a
  no-op: `claude --resume <dead id>` prints *"No conversation found with session ID: <uuid>"* and
  EXITS, leaving the pane at a bare shell under a node still wearing its agent badge. Measured
  2026-09-09 on the reporting host (`nodeterm-rmt`, 108 live sessions): **20** panes sat in exactly
  that state, and not one of those 20 ids had a `<id>.jsonl` anywhere under the system
  `~/.claude/projects` or the managed account root. Claude's own 30-day cleanup, a `/clear`, a
  removed account and an id minted for a session that never ran all produce it. So the cold-restore
  branch now asks `chat.transcriptExists` first (`transcript:exists`, served by
  `registerTranscriptIpc` in BOTH shells) and, on a POSITIVE `absent`, launches the agent **bare**
  and raises a slim `CoState.lostSession` banner on the node — "The previous conversation could not
  be found — this agent started fresh." — instead of opening a blank session in silence. Three
  rules make that safe:
  - **The answer is a TRI-state** (`TranscriptPresence`: `present | absent | unknown`) and only
    `absent` drops the id. The two errors are wildly asymmetric — wrongly resuming a dead id costs
    one line and a bare shell (today's bug), wrongly dropping a LIVE id strands work the user
    believes is continuing — so an unreadable root, a `readdir` that threw, a downed ControlMaster,
    a relay tab, a rejected call and an id we would not put on a command line are ALL `unknown` =
    resume exactly as before. `transcriptPresence` (`core/transcript-reader.ts`) is
    `resolveTranscriptPath` plus that one distinction, not a second way of finding a transcript,
    and a root that does not exist at all still answers `unknown` on purpose: cold restore runs at
    boot, where a not-yet-mounted `$HOME` is indistinguishable from an empty one.
  - **The remote leg's `unknown` is TERMINAL, never a fallthrough.** A remote session's transcript
    is on the host, so searching this machine for it would find nothing and report `absent` about
    the wrong computer. `remoteTranscriptPresence` (`src/main`) exists beside
    `remoteTranscriptRefFor` rather than reusing it because that function collapses "not remote" /
    "no home" / "ssh failed" / "the host looked and there is nothing" into one `undefined` — fine
    for a reader that falls back, fatal for a caller that acts on absence.
    `locateRemoteTranscriptCommand` was already built for this distinction (it exits 0 on a clean
    miss, "so no transcript is an ANSWER, not a failed ssh"), and that is the property this reads;
    it is deliberately more permissive than the local leg (it searches the account root AND the
    system root), which errs toward `present` = keep the resume.
  - **Claude only**, gated by `readsClaudeTranscript` — a codex/gemini/grok id misses this
    resolver by construction every time, so probing one would answer `absent` for a healthy
    session and drop its resume. Those agents keep the pre-existing behaviour until the probe
    learns their layouts (`handoff/locate.ts` has the per-agent locators; that is the seam).
  Decision logic is the pure `terminal/cold-resume-session.ts`. **Adding a `CoState` field owes the
  hand-written equality list in `setCo`** — a patch touching only an uncompared field is SWALLOWED
  and its banner silently never renders (it happened once to `spawnError`);
  `nodes/cold-resume-wiring.test.ts` now asserts every field of the interface appears there.
  Surfaces: Desktop full; Server Edition full (the handler is core, the ws-bridge leg is real, and
  that shell runs on the host whose transcripts it reads, so it needs no remote leg); relay tabs
  answer `unknown` and resume as before. **Not yet on the kanban CARD MODAL** — `ModalTerminal`
  reads no `CoState`, so a user who only ever opens the session from the board does not see the
  notice; the honest fix is a shared node-notice surface rather than a second copy of the banner.

### SSH connect: the ControlMaster is published BEFORE its setup chain

`connectOnce` (`main/remote-ssh/ssh-project.ts`) used to publish a project's ControlMaster only with
`status: 'connected'` — i.e. after the reverse hook tunnel, ~23 serialized per-agent hook installs,
`printf $HOME`, the remote tmux.conf write + `source-file` and the Codex runtime staging had all
run. MEASURED against a real sshd through a 25 ms one-way delay proxy (50 ms RTT): that chain is
**3.54 s** on a fully-provisioned host, while **18 remote terminals attaching in parallel over a
warm master paint in a median of 0.16 s** and are all settled by 0.71 s. So the attach was never the
bottleneck — every terminal of a switched-to project simply sat in `resolveSshRemote`'s 20 s wait
printing `[connecting to user@host…]` into a blank pane, for a transport that was ready the whole
time.

Two additive changes, and the rules that keep them safe:

- **The early signal.** The moment `ssh -O check` answers, `connectOnce` emits
  `SshProjectStatusEvent.masterControlPath` on a `connecting` event. `connected` keeps its exact
  meaning (the whole chain finished) and everything hanging off it — git routing, the remote claude
  probe, the tunnel resync, the connection banner — is untouched. The renderer keeps it in its own
  map (`useSshConn.earlyByProject`), **never in `byProject`**, which a dozen readers treat as "this
  project is connected".
  - **Only a node whose remote tmux session ALREADY EXISTS may act on it**
    (`PtyApi.remoteSessionConfirmed` → `RemoteSessionIndex.verdict`, the strict `present`-only half
    of the coalesced `tmux list-sessions` read `create()` already makes, so a warm switch pays no
    extra round trip). `new-session -A` on a live session merely attaches, and the two things the
    setup chain provides — the remote tmux config (`-f`) and the hook/account environment (tmux
    `-e`) — are read at session CREATION only. A node whose session is ABSENT, **or whose host
    could not be read**, waits for `connected`: creating its session without the hook env costs it
    its agent-status badges silently, with no later event to repair it. That is why the index now
    exposes a TRI-STATE (`present | absent | unknown`) — `exists()` folds `unknown` into "exists"
    for its own caller, and this one needs the opposite fold. Decision logic is the pure
    `renderer/lib/sshRemoteWait.ts`; a cold node's wait is pinned by its own test.
  - **Never for an ADOPTED live-orphan master.** The tunnel-verification failure path may `-O exit`
    that master and rebuild it, which would kill a terminal that had attached over it meanwhile.
    The rebuild clears `reusedOrphan` and re-enters the loop, so a rebuilt master does publish.
- **The boot-time pre-warm** (`core/remote-ssh/ssh-prewarm.ts`, planner + runner pure and tested;
  wired in `main/index.ts`). The master for a project was dialed only when the user first switched
  to it, so the first visit of every app run paid the cold establish (**0.44 s** measured) plus the
  whole chain. `SshProjectManager.prewarm` now dials the masters of OPEN SSH projects shortly after
  boot, **one host at a time** (a burst of fresh masters is what trips a host's `MaxStartups`; the
  `SshChildGate` caps exec children per control path and does nothing about logins).
  - **A pre-warm is SILENT — no status event at all.** The user is by definition not looking (if
    they were, the active-project effect would have connected it loudly), so a failure must not
    raise the connection banner for a project they never opened. The mark is lifted the moment a
    real connect arrives for the same project, including one that coalesces onto the pre-warm's own
    in-flight attempt.
  - **It never prompts for a passphrase either** (`isQuietMasterPid` → main's prompt handler
    declines): a modal in front of a user who opened nothing is the loudest thing an SSH connect can
    do. That master fails auth quietly; the user's own connect spawns a new one and prompts normally.
  - **CLOSED projects are never dialed**, and neither is a project that already has a master or an
    attempt in flight. `closeProject` is non-destructive, so a closed tab is the user saying "not
    now".

### When a freshness verdict was a GUESS: the late cold-start check

The cold-restore section above states the rule that makes the remote freshness read safe: only
tmux's own exit 1 is evidence of absence, and every other outcome answers "exists", because a
transport failure read as "cold" types `claude --resume …` into a LIVE agent pane. That rule is
right and does not change. What it costs, and what this closes, is the other side of the fold.

**THE INCIDENT (measured on the reporting host, 2026-09-15).** The host's `nodeterm-rmt` tmux
server died, so every remote session was gone; ten minutes later a 108-node SSH project was opened
and 107 sessions had to be created in one mount burst. sshd logged **757 `Accepted publickey` full
logins in seven minutes** — on a healthy ControlMaster that number is ~0, because everything
multiplexes over one connection. Under that pressure the freshness read times out, the fold answers
"exists", `tmux new-session -A` CREATES an empty session, `fresh:false` skips cold restore, and the
node sits at a bare shell with the user's conversation stranded on disk:

    15:29 burst,  22 sessions: 18 claude /  4 bash  ->  82% resumed
    15:39 burst, 107 sessions: 41 claude / 66 bash  ->  38% resumed

Load-dependent, i.e. a race. Three changes, and the order matters — the first saves the
conversation, the other two stop the burst that strands it:

- **A second opinion, never a different fold.** `create()` now reports `freshUnverified` when
  `fresh:false` came from an `unknown` verdict rather than a read. The renderer re-asks ONCE, after
  the attach has landed and the burst is over, and tmux settles it authoritatively:
  `#{session_created}` survives a `new-session -A` attach, so a session created within seconds of
  our own attach is one WE made (`PtyApi.sessionAge` → `remoteSessionAgeArgs`, which prints the
  stamp AND the host's `date +%s` on one line so the host's clock skew never enters the number).
  Every rule in `renderer/terminal/cold-self-heal.ts` is a refusal: never for a verdict that was
  READ (that would spend a round trip per warm node on every switch), never for an unknown age,
  never past the window, and never unless a SHELL still owns the pane — the same gate the
  hibernation wake and the resume-miss watcher keep. The scrollback replay is deliberately NOT
  re-run: by then tmux has painted the live pane, and writing a snapshot over it splices two points
  in time (the warm-attach seeding rule). The agent relaunch is what matters and is what runs.
- **The per-node token write is coalesced, not gated** — the brief that prompted this said
  `ensureRemoteNodeToken` bypassed the `SshChildGate`, and that was measurably wrong: main wires
  `RemoteHooks` with the gated runner, so it queues like everything else. The real cost was that it
  is one round trip PER SPAWN for work the connect path already did (`materialiseNodeTokens` writes
  every node's token), competing for a budget of 6 for the whole burst. It now memoizes per
  (control path, node) for the app run — seeded by the connect — and coalesces a burst into ONE
  remote write.
- **Remote pty spawns are paced** (`core/remote-ssh/pty-spawn-gate.ts`, cap 4 per ControlMaster).
  A pty deliberately never went through the `SshChildGate` — "a terminal is never queued for a
  screen the user is looking at" — which is right for a handful of terminals and wrong for a
  canvas. The one thing that makes pacing acceptable is that a slot is held only until the session
  starts painting: released on the pty's FIRST OUTPUT (one round trip for a warm attach) and
  unconditionally after `REMOTE_PTY_SPAWN_SETTLE_MS`, because a gate that can hang is worse than no
  gate. A node that ends up waiting SAYS so (`SLOW_REMOTE_SPAWN_NOTICE_MS`), for the same reason the
  `[connecting…]` line exists. Measured in the lab (real sshd, `MaxSessions 10`, 50 ms RTT, one warm
  master, 107 attaches):

  | | full logins | panes painted | wall |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | ungated | 72 / 77 | 102 and 96 of 107 | 2.1 / 2.3 s |
  | gated at 4 | **1** / **1** | **107 / 107** | 3.2 / 4.0 s |

  Wall time is the price and it is the right trade: ungated, five to eleven panes never painted at
  all inside a 20 s budget — the same shape `remote-session-index.ts` reports for its own burst.

### We have our own VT emulator — check it before asking tmux

xterm.js is not just a renderer. It parses the pane's output stream, so it **tracks DECSET modes
itself** and exposes them as public API (`term.modes`, `@xterm/xterm/typings/xterm.d.ts:1865`) —
bracketed paste, application-cursor, mouse tracking, origin mode, and the rest. We already read one
of them: `term.modes.mouseTrackingMode` decides whether a click means "follow this file link"
(`src/renderer/terminal/file-links.ts:341`).

We once did the opposite. `PtyManager.bracketPasteRequested` (now **deleted** — see the tombstone
in `pty-manager.ts`) asked **tmux** for the same class of fact, via `#{bracket_paste_flag}` — and
that format **first shipped in tmux 3.7** (2026-06-26). Ubuntu 24.04 LTS ships 3.4, Ubuntu 22.04 →
3.2a, Debian 12/13 → 3.3a/3.5a, Ubuntu 26.04 → 3.6a. On all of those it expanded to `''` exactly
like a bogus name, and the comparison against `'1'` answered **false for every pane**. The bundled
tmux did not rescue it: `extraResources` places it under `"mac"` only, and `bundledTmuxPath` is
deliberately the **last** candidate (see the comment at `pty-manager.ts:245-250` — preferring our
binary would pair a new client with the user's older running *server*, which upstream refuses). On
an **SSH project it was unfixable from our side entirely**: the remote's tmux is whatever the
user's server has.

**The rule this is an instance of: before asking tmux, ssh or `ps` something about a pane, check
whether the emulator already knows it.** Facts about *what the app in the pane is doing* (VT modes,
the alternate screen, the cursor shape it asked for) arrive as bytes we already parse. Facts about
*the session* (does it exist, what is the foreground process group, which panes are in it) are
genuinely tmux's and must be asked. Mixing the two up is how a feature acquires a dependency on a
tmux version we do not control. herdr has no version problem here for exactly this reason — it
reads `mode_get(MODE_BRACKETED_PASTE)` from its own state machine.

**Measured, and the emulator is NOT the answer here.** The `?2004h` a tmux *client* receives is
tmux's own paste-through on the outer terminal (`tty_start_tty`, gated on the outer terminfo
`BE`/`BD`), not the pane app's request: it arrives ~5 ms after attach and reads `true` even for a
pane running `sleep 30`. It never toggled across pane switches, window switches, re-attach or
co-attach. A constant is not a signal — so `term.modes.bracketedPasteMode` cannot stand in for the
pane's state, however tempting the symmetry with `mouseTrackingMode` looks.

**That paragraph is about a tmux CLIENT, and the SESSION HOST is the opposite case** (issue #686).
On Windows there is no tmux, so nothing sits between the pane's app and the host's headless
emulator: a `?2004h` it sees was written by the app itself, which is exactly the fact
`paste-buffer -p` asks tmux for. `HostSession.bracketedPasteRequested()` reads it (behind
`outputTail`, like `serialize` — xterm applies writes asynchronously, so an early read answers "no"
for the turn that just enabled it) and `sendKeysWrites` (`session-host/send-keys-delivery.ts`)
sanitizes ALWAYS and frames only when the app asked. Separate writes alone can still be read
as one burst (#780). Both native Windows `sendText` and host `sendKeys` now execute through
`core/settled-text.ts`: capture a baseline, paste without Enter, then poll at 40 ms for at most
15 polls for a changed, stable screen containing the sanitized text. Only then write one Enter,
after rechecking liveness/generation and paste mode. Unknown capture, unchanged output or timeout
leaves the paste unsubmitted and returns `pasted-not-submitted`, never `true`. The discriminant
survives IPC/WS and `sendKeysV2`; canvas writes name the partial delivery, trigger runs record
a terminal miss (including queue flush), and one-way UI writers raise a visible warning. Test
success with `=== true`, never truthiness. Do not retry an unconfirmed submit and duplicate the paste. Overlapping sendText operations on the same pane
are refused before input; insert-only, empty Enter and unframed input retain their contracts.
A collapsed/hidden/oversize paste may require manual Enter. This is an observed-screen heuristic,
not an application acknowledgement. Linux fake-PTY tests cover a 150 ms busy reader; real Windows
Codex/Claude, context-link/write, dictation and rename device checks remain required. Existing
hosts refuse the additive `sendKeysV2` command until they retire; no raw-write fallback or
automatic host restart is performed. Legacy clients still use the existing `sendKeys` command.


**The actual fix is older than the problem: `paste-buffer -p`.** From tmux's own man page — *"If
`-p` is specified, paste bracket control codes are inserted around the buffer **if the application
has requested bracketed paste mode**."* Introduced 2012-03-03, shipped in **tmux 1.7**, so it is
present on every tmux in the field. We do not have to ask whether the app wants framing; we ask
tmux to do the framing, and it applies the pane's real state. Measured on 3.4: framed when the app
requested it, unframed when it did not, correct for a non-active pane, and the whole thing in one
round trip —
`tmux load-buffer -b nt - \; if-shell -F -t <target> '#{pane_in_mode}' 'send-keys -t <target> -X
cancel' \; paste-buffer -d -p -r -b nt -t <target> \; send-keys -t <target> Enter` (`-r` keeps
`\n` as `\n` instead of tmux's default `\n`→`\r` rewrite; see `tmux-naming.ts`).

Two hazards that come with it, both measured:
- **Copy mode silently unframes.** With `#{pane_in_mode}` = 1, `paste-buffer -p` delivers unframed
  (tmux checks the copy-mode screen, not the app), so a user who scrolled the wheel up gets the
  one-turn-per-line bug. The `if-shell` guard above runs `send-keys -X cancel` first — only when the
  pane is in copy mode — in the same invocation, restoring it.
- **`set-buffer -- "$text"` hits ARG_MAX** around 200 KB. Use `load-buffer -` over stdin — and on
  the SSH path that means piping into the remote command rather than putting the text in argv.

There is no longer a probe or a fallback to weigh: `sendText` delivers through `paste-buffer -p`
**unconditionally** (the plan builders live in `tmux-naming.ts`). The old two-step path — probe
`#{bracket_paste_flag}`, and on a false answer deliver `line1\nline2\nline3\r`, raw newlines into
the app that *mangled* every multi-line write on a pre-3.7 tmux — is gone with the probe.

### Seeding a fresh xterm (`attachReplay` / `seedPaint` in `terminal/terminal-config.ts`)

A newly mounted xterm is empty. Since tmux paints its own client, there is usually **nothing to
seed** — the cases are:
- **`none`** — the terminal was **parked** (its buffer is still live and correct), or it is a
  brand-new node with an `initialCommand`. Seeding either would duplicate content.
- **`cold-snapshot`** (`fresh` — reboot/first open) — the tmux session is genuinely gone, so replay
  the persisted `scrollback-store` snapshot, with a "session restored" separator.
- **`warm-attach`** (`!fresh` — app restart, tmux still alive) — **seed nothing.** tmux is attached
  to this client: it redraws the visible screen and owns the history under the wheel. This is where
  a `warm-history` hydration (`transport.captureHistory` → `tmux capture-pane`) used to run; it was
  **removed**, because writing into a buffer that tmux then repaints is what produced the black
  bands and duplicated screens. The single exception is a **co-attach joiner** (`seedPaint` →
  `create-screen`): tmux only repaints on SIGWINCH, so a joiner that did not resize never gets a
  redraw, and the screen captured server-side inside `create()` (`PtyCreateResult.screen`) is the
  only thing that paints it — see docs/team-presence.md. **A co-attach joiner also misses tmux's
  MOUSE-TRACKING modes** (`?1000h/?1002h/?1006h`): tmux emits them only at its OWN attach, and
  neither the `screen` capture (`capture-pane` carries no private modes) nor a SIGWINCH redraw
  re-sends them — so the joiner's wheel can't scroll tmux history until a keystroke makes the app
  re-request mouse. `join()` therefore sets `PtyCreateResult.coAttachMouse` for tmux-backed joins
  (gated on `persistKey`, on BOTH the screen and resize branches) and the renderer writes
  `CO_ATTACH_MOUSE_SEQ` into the fresh xterm (both `ModalTerminal` and `TerminalNode`). tmux is
  always `mouse on`, so this matches its invariant client state; the enable is idempotent. Was the
  "can't scroll the kanban card-modal terminal until you press a key" bug. **A co-attach joiner
  ALSO misses tmux's attach-time `\e[?1049h`**, and a renderer reload is a joiner too (it re-joins
  the SAME still-alive tmux client via `join()`, so tmux never re-attaches it). `join()` therefore
  sets `coAttachAltScreen` for tmux-backed sessions only — gated on `tmuxBacked && !sessionHost`,
  never plain-shell/session-host, whose normal-buffer scrollback is their only history — and the
  renderer writes `CO_ATTACH_ALT_SCREEN_SEQ` **BEFORE** painting (entering the alternate buffer
  clears the display, so writing it after would erase the paint; TerminalNode skips it once a
  resync has superseded the seed, since that repaint may already be on screen). **Known
  limitation of "never plain-shell":** a REMOTE SSH session on a host WITHOUT tmux
  (`tmuxOrExplain`'s plain login-shell fallback) is still recorded `tmuxBacked` — core cannot tell
  from here that the remote command degraded — so it too gets the alt switch (and `coAttachMouse`,
  and `tmuxClient`'s resync re-apply), hiding that shell's normal-buffer scrollback; detecting the
  degrade is a follow-up. Without it a
  renderer reload left every terminal on the normal buffer, piling up to 10k lines of scrollback
  and forcing a layout per output frame — measured 16.1% vs 7.3% CPU for one terminal at
  20 lines/s, 313 vs 1 forced layouts per 20 s. **A resync repaint loses the same two modes**:
  `repaintResync`'s `term.reset()` drops ANY terminal — the solo spawn too, not only a joiner —
  back to the normal buffer and clears mouse tracking, and resyncs happen under backpressure, i.e.
  on exactly the streaming terminals the alt switch exists for. So every create now reports
  `PtyCreateResult.tmuxClient` (same `tmuxBacked && !sessionHost` gate, set on spawn AND join), and
  `repaintResync` writes `CO_ATTACH_ALT_SCREEN_SEQ + CO_ATTACH_MOUSE_SEQ` between the reset and the
  paint when it is set. Optional on purpose: an older core or relay peer omits it and gets the old
  behavior (nothing re-applied), never a guess. The recycle banner ("session restarted by another
  user") is written AFTER the joiner's seed paint for the same reason — written before the alt
  switch, it sat in a buffer nobody could see.

xterm's own `scrollback` (`xtermScrollback(settings.tmuxScrollback)`, floored at 1000, capped at
`XTERM_SCROLLBACK_MAX` = 10000) is kept for the sessions tmux does *not* back (a plain shell when
tmux is unavailable) and for the cold-snapshot replay — it is not what the user scrolls in a tmux
session.

## Terminal node lifecycle (gotchas)

`src/renderer/nodes/TerminalNode.tsx` is the trickiest file:

- The xterm instance + PTY session are created once in a `useEffect(…, [data.respawnNonce,
  offscreenEpoch])` and torn down on unmount. The component persists across re-renders because
  React Flow keys nodes by `id` — never change a node's id, or you'll respawn its terminal.
  **Third in-place state — "released" (2026-08-11, offscreen dispose):** a node fully offscreen
  in the canvas viewport for `settings.offscreenTerminalMinutes` (default 10, `0` = never;
  Settings → tmux) has its xterm + PTY client torn down IN PLACE — node stays mounted showing a
  plate, tmux session untouched — and revives (warm reattach) when it re-approaches the viewport.
  Pure policy: `terminal/offscreen-policy.ts`. Two load-bearing rules a refactor must not undo:
  (1) the **visibility IntersectionObserver lives in its own mount-stable `[termKey]` effect**,
  NOT the lifecycle effect — the down transition re-runs the lifecycle effect, and an observer
  owned there dies with it, making revive unreachable (permanent plate; caught in review). The
  lifecycle run publishes to it through refs (`visibilityReportRef`, `offscreenLiveRef`,
  identity-checked on clear). (2) The remote exclusion asks `offscreenCoreIsRemote(session.source)`
  (`'local'` only is eligible — relay/server tabs excluded), NOT `data.remote`, **a field nothing
  sets on node data** (a gate on it was constant false and type-invisible; pinned by tests).
  SSH-project nodes are also excluded; collapsed = hidden (same convention as the WebGL budget);
  a `respawnNonce` bump while released revives first. Agent-status/fan-out clears live in a
  dedicated unmount-only effect (a release or respawn must not blank a live badge).
- **React StrictMode is deliberately not used** (`main.tsx`) — double-mount would spawn
  two PTYs per node.
- The xterm container is `nodrag nowheel`; a transparent **hover-guard** overlay sits on top
  until you dwell `settings.panHoverDelay` (so quick drag = move node, scroll = pan). After
  the dwell the guard is removed and xterm takes input. The header stays draggable.
- **Where the wheel stops being the terminal's is decided by HIT TEST, per packet** — `Canvas.tsx`
  answers `overNativeScrollable` with `target?.closest('.nowheel')`, and React Flow's own
  `panOnScroll` walks the same class (`noWheelClassName`). Two consequences, and issue #767 reported
  the second as the first. **(a) Inside the body the wheel is already the terminal's, band
  included.** `.term-node__xterm` carries `nowheel` AND is `position: absolute; inset: 0` over a
  body with no padding and no border, so the visible inset band (the host's own `4px 2px 6px 6px`)
  and a co-attach letterbox band are part of the HOST's hit area — MEASURED with `elementFromPoint`
  under headless Chromium against the verbatim rules, and now pinned as a three-link CSS invariant
  by `canvas/terminal-wheel-boundary.test.ts`. The styles.css line the report reads ("insets the
  xterm by a few px") is about PAINT — the band shows the body's `--term-bg` because the host paints
  none — and paint is not hit testing. An overlay laid over a LIVE terminal therefore owes
  `pointer-events: none` (`.term-node__stalecwd`, joining `.term-node__upload` and
  `.term-copy-pill`); an overlay that REPLACES a dead view (`.term-node__offscreen`,
  `.term-node__closed`) deliberately keeps the canvas wheel — there is nothing underneath to
  scroll, so panning is the useful answer. **(b) The boundary that actually moves is TEMPORAL, not
  spatial**: while it is up, `.term-hover-guard` covers the whole body and is NOT `nowheel`, so for
  the first `panHoverDelay` after the pointer enters — and again after it leaves — a wheel over
  terminal TEXT pans the canvas. That is the guard's own contract ("quick drag = move node, scroll
  = pan canvas") and the reason those incidents cannot be reproduced on demand. Hoisting `nowheel`
  to `.term-node__body` would swallow the guard with it (a second consumer, React Flow's, reads the
  class the same way and no per-element opt-out can reach it); hoisting it to the whole NODE would
  additionally take wheel-zoom-to-cursor away over every node, which is exactly where a
  `wheelZoom` user aims.
- **FitAddon reads the host's computed size, not its content rect.** The absolute, inset
  canvas host uses `box-sizing: content-box` so its padding is excluded from that size
  (#671). Its outer hit/plate rect still fills the body. The board modal instead keeps
  padding on a separate wrapper. Do not put border-box padding back on a fit host:
  it over-reports rows and clips the last line. `scripts/terminal-fit-layout.test.ts`
  measures real xterm layout through resize sweeps at DPR 1, 1.25, 1.5 and 2 in Chrome
  (`CHROME_BIN` overrides the executable); this does not verify GPU row-seam rendering.
- A `ResizeObserver` drives `FitAddon.fit()` + `transport.resize`. Canvas zoom is a CSS
  transform, so it does *not* change `clientWidth` — cols/rows stay stable across zoom.
  `scale-fix.ts` patches xterm's mouse coords so text selection stays aligned when zoomed.

## Node kinds (all rendered by React Flow custom nodes)

- **terminal** (`TerminalNode.tsx`) — xterm + tmux (see above). Header: collapse, color,
  click-to-rename title, ✦ AI-name, ×. Body has a **hover guard** overlay: dwell
  `settings.panHoverDelay` (default 600 ms) before the terminal takes focus — before that,
  drag = move node, scroll = pan canvas. **Cmd/Ctrl+M** (while hovered) toggles a markdown
  render of the captured output — `nodes/TerminalMarkdownView.tsx`, which takes a node id + a
  `capture` function (no React Flow context, so the kanban card modal can reuse it) and owns the
  lifecycle: capture on mount + a ↻ refresh, a request token that drops stale/late answers, an
  explicit empty state ('' is an answer; a rejected capture is a failure, not empty), only the
  LAST `MD_OUTPUT_MAX_LINES` (5000) lines rendered and announced when cut, scrolled to the latest
  output. Entering the view (output or ChatPanel) blurs the xterm; leaving it restores focus
  only if the terminal had it on entry AND focus is now nowhere or still inside this node
  (`terminal/useMdModeFocus.ts`). While the view is open, every "take the keyboard" path (hover
  dwell, click, sidebar/notification jump) goes through `focusXtermUnlessCovered` and leaves the
  hidden xterm unfocused — the overlay sits inside the node body, so a dwell over it used to route
  keystrokes into a pane nobody could see. The body's file DROP / file PASTE handlers (which focus
  the xterm and paste paths into it) are the other way in, and they stand aside while covered
  (`terminalOwnsFileInput`): a screenshot pasted into the ChatPanel composer used to be caught in
  the capture phase and typed as a path into the hidden pane. Both are source-pinned in
  `useMdModeFocus.test.tsx`. Tag chips via `NodeTags`.
  **Selection + copy is tmux's** (its mouse is on — see the tmux section): drag to select, wheel to
  scroll tmux's history. A drag copies via copy-mode, and tmux emits **OSC 52** to the client, whose
  handler writes the **system clipboard** — the one copy path on every platform *and* over SSH (no
  `pbcopy`). OSC 52 writes an app emits itself (vim `"+y`, gh, yazi) reach the clipboard through the
  same handler (write-only — a read query is refused). The emulator's own copy chords stay for a
  selection xterm *does* own (`copyKeyAction`/`isCopyShortcut`): **Cmd+C** (mac), **Ctrl+Shift+C**
  and **Ctrl+Insert** (Linux/Windows) — matched on `e.key` *or* the physical `KeyC`, so non-Latin
  layouts still copy. A copy chord is **always swallowed**, selection or not: letting Ctrl+Shift+C
  fall through would reach the pty as `\x03` (SIGINT). Ctrl+Insert exists because Chromium reserves
  Ctrl+Shift+C for the inspector and a page cannot `preventDefault()` it — which is where Server
  Edition users land. Plain **Ctrl+C** is never intercepted.
  **Text paste uses the platform event** (`isPasteShortcut` → the `'native'` action): ⌘V on
  mac reaches the Edit menu's `{role:'paste'}`, whose `paste` event xterm frames
  as a bracketed paste. All the terminal does is stop CANCELLING the chord, and that is a
  **Windows-only** claim: xterm's keymap turns Ctrl+V into `\x16` with `cancel`, which suppressed
  Chromium's paste command *and* the Ctrl+V accelerator behind it, so Ctrl+V pasted nothing at all
  there (issue #562). Off Windows the chord stays `\x16` on purpose — mac pastes with ⌘V, Linux
  with Ctrl+Shift+V, and Ctrl+V is a key vim/readline users really send. Ctrl+Shift+V and
  Shift+Insert need no branch: measured against `evaluateKeyboardEvent`, xterm produces neither a
  key nor a cancel for them, so the platform already pastes. To select in **xterm** instead of tmux
  (or inside an app that grabs the mouse, like vim/htop), hold **Option** (mac —
  xterm's `macOptionClickForcesSelection`) or **Shift** (Linux/Windows) while dragging.
  **Screenshot paste (#712):** the capture handler in both TerminalNode and ModalTerminal
  owns files/images: save/upload, then paste the path, suppressing accompanying text. A
  macOS Ctrl+V may instead let a local foreground agent read its own system clipboard.
  Configured agent identity proves neither foreground state nor clipboard support, and a
  PTY write has no image receipt. Never synthesize that key or fall back between routes.
  The macOS shortcuts reference explains both keys; its Server Edition copy explicitly
  says Ctrl+V cannot transfer the viewer's clipboard to the host. SSH keeps remote uploads.
  **Copying now says so**: the OSC 52 handler floats a transient `Copied N lines` pill over the
  terminal's BOTTOM-RIGHT corner (`.term-copy-pill`, the same class on the canvas node and the
  kanban card modal — one session seen twice must not speak in two voices; bottom-right because
  every agent CLI writes its input line bottom-left, and `pointer-events: none` because it sits on
  the terminal and fires on every copy), because tmux's `copy-pipe-and-cancel`
  clears the highlight at the exact instant it copies — which read as "the copy failed" to a user
  whose other pane ran claude. And a drag that produced NEITHER an OSC 52 nor an xterm selection
  means the pane's app captured the mouse (claude does, codex does not), so a one-time
  `Hold ⌥ to select text` hint fires instead (`nodeterm.seenSelectHint`). **The whole layer is
  OFF for an agent in `SELF_REPORTS_COPY` (`reportsOwnCopy` — claude, which prints its own
  "copied N chars to tmux buffer" line): a second message for one gesture is noise, and a claude
  terminal is byte-identical to before the feature. **One owner per pill:**
  the `copied` receipt is raised ONLY by the OSC 52 path, the hint ONLY by the drag path — the two
  never race for the same slot. The emulator's own copy **chord** (Cmd+C / Ctrl+Shift+C) deliberately
  raises nothing: Claude Code prints its own copy line ("copied N chars to tmux buffer"), and a
  second message for one gesture is noise. Decision logic is the pure `terminal/copy-feedback.ts`;
  `useCopyFeedback` is the glue (it also yields to a clipboard-failure `nodeterm:toast`, so the
  Server Edition never shows a green receipt beside a red banner), and the node publishes its sink
  through the module-level `copySubs` map because the OSC handler survives a park.
  **Shift+Enter** is remapped to `\x1b\r` (ESC+CR / M-Enter) so agent CLIs insert a newline
  instead of submitting (`terminalKeyAction` / `SHIFT_ENTER_SEQ` in `terminal-config.ts`; sent in
  all terminals — harmless in a plain shell). **Cmd (mac) / Ctrl+click** opens links in the
  output: URLs → default browser (`@xterm/addon-web-links`), file paths → editor node and
  directories → Explorer reveal (`terminal/file-links.ts`, existence-verified against the project
  fs via cached parent-dir listings, with `path:line[:col]` compiler-output suffixes). The path
  dialect follows the FILESYSTEM-OWNING CORE, not the viewer: desktop-local may use its own
  platform, Server Edition and relay tabs use the core's reported `process.platform`, and SSH
  projects are POSIX. A failed host-platform read disables file links for that connection — it
  never guesses from the browser. Standalone `ssh` terminal nodes remain URL-only because they
  have no remote fs API with which to verify a token; relay tabs do have a core-bound, jailed fs
  API and therefore support file links. Windows existence matching is case-insensitive and accepts
  both separators; UNC tokens are refused whole before they can be reinterpreted as cwd-relative.
  **Home-relative `~/x` tokens** (Claude Code prints its plan file as `~/.claude/plans/<name>.md`)
  stay `~`-rooted all the way to the fs call and are expanded by the core that OWNS the filesystem
  — `expandHomePath` in `core/fs-handlers.ts` for desktop/Server Edition, the remote shell for
  `sshFs` — because the renderer does not know that home. A `~` after a path character (`a~/x`)
  or `~user/x` is not a home path and yields no link. The relay's jailed `fs.*` calls fs-ops
  directly and does not expand, so a relay tab's `~` token fails closed (no link).
- **Agent** (`createAgentNode(agentId, …)`) — a terminal preset that runs an agent CLI as its
  `initialCommand` (runs once on open via `transport.write`, then cleared), with `data.agentId`
  set. Builtins (`claude`/`codex`/`gemini`) come from `AGENT_CONFIG` (clay color etc.).
  Agent nodes get extra behavior **gated by the
  agent's capabilities** (see **Agent support** below): a busy/working badge + unread dot +
  completion notification + session-name chip (hook-capable agents), content search, and the
  Claude-only **Branch conversation** action. Custom user-defined agents spawn + show
  process/terminal-title status only.
- **sticky** (`StickyNode.tsx`) — colored note, free text, collapsible. Has link handles:
  connect a sticky to any terminal node to attach the note as context (see Context Link).
- **group** (`GroupNode.tsx`) — real React Flow parent/child frame, and frames **nest** (2026-08):
  a group may contain other groups to any depth. `groupSelectedNodes` wraps objects that share ONE
  container — frames included — creating the wrapper inside that container; a mixed-container set,
  or an ancestor selected together with its own descendant, is **refused** rather than scrambled
  (positions are only comparable within one container, and the descendant would be torn out of the
  ancestor being wrapped). Box-selection routinely catches both, so structural actions normalize
  the selection to its subtree roots first (`selectedRootIds`). `ungroupNodes` promotes a frame's
  direct children into **its own parent** (not to the root — that would move them by the whole
  ancestor offset); `reparentNode` moves a node OR a whole frame subtree, keeps its **root-space**
  position fixed (`rootPosition`, not the old add-one-parent's-origin math) and refuses a cycle;
  `addSelectionToGroup` adds a selection to an existing frame; `reorderGroupWithinParent` reorders
  a frame among its siblings, carrying its subtree. `nodeStatesToFlow`/`groupsFirst` emit frames
  **depth-first from the root** — a flat "groups first" sort is not enough once two groups compare
  equal — and that persisted order is also the downgrade contract (a pre-nesting build's stable
  sort leaves it alone, so a nested tree still hydrates parent-first and renders there).
  **A frame that gains a child bigger than itself is re-fitted, ancestors included**
  (`fitGroupToChildren` up the chain): a wrapper created at `(minX-28, minY-62)` relative to its
  parent is routinely negative, and `extent:'parent'` would make React Flow clamp it into an
  inverted range — snapping the frame hundreds of px away and dragging the whole wrapped subtree
  with it. Visually: a dashed rounded frame in the group color with a floating label pill (color
  dot + editable name) on the top border and ungroup/× top-right (on hover/selected). **The pill
  is the frame's `dragHandle`** and the frame body is `pointer-events: none` — a frame is a
  background container, not a giant drag target, so its body passes clicks to the pane and an
  outer frame cannot swallow the clicks meant for a frame drawn inside it. The
  `NodeResizer` line is hidden (`lineStyle` transparent) so it can't draw a sharp-cornered
  box; the selection ring is a `box-shadow` instead, which follows the same `border-radius`.
- **editor** (`EditorNode.tsx`) — Monaco code editor for a `filePath`; reads/writes via
  `fs:read`/`fs:write`, auto-detects language from the path, ⌘S saves, dirty dot. A
  **Preview / Edit** toggle (or ⌘M while hovered) renders the live content as markdown.
  **Image files** (png/jpg/gif/webp/bmp/ico/svg/avif) skip Monaco and show an `<img>`
  preview instead — read as base64 via `fs:read-binary` into a `data:` URL (CSP allows
  `img-src data:`), on a checkerboard backdrop with the pixel dimensions in the header.
- **diff** (`DiffNode.tsx`) — Monaco diff editor; `diffStaged` chooses HEAD↔index (staged)
  vs index↔working (unstaged) via `git:show-file` + `fs:read`. Read-only.
- **video** (`VideoNode.tsx`) — a video player; a local file is served over the `nt-media://`
  protocol (allowlisted on mount via `media.allow`) with native controls; an SSH-project file
  (`data.sshFs`) is first pulled into the local media cache over the project's ControlMaster
  (`media.allowSsh`) then played the same way.
- **web** (`WebNode.tsx`) — an Electron `<webview>` (locked down, no `nodeintegration`) that loads
  a live `data.url`, or serves local html at `data.filePath` over `nt-media://`.
- **browser** (`BrowserNode.tsx`) — a navigable Chromium browser wrapping the shared
  `BrowserSurface` (webview + toolbar); the last top-level URL persists to `data.url`, and the same
  surface backs the kanban card modal's browser popup.
  **Page zoom is owned by the GUEST boundary, not the canvas DOM** (`@shared/webview-zoom` +
  `main/webview-zoom.ts`, 2026-09-20). Measured on Electron 42.10.1 with a physical wheel injection:
  Ctrl+wheel over the page arrived in its OOPIF with `ctrl=true`, the host received NO `wheel`
  event, and Electron left the factor at 1 until the guest `WebContents`'s `zoom-changed` handler
  called `setZoomLevel` (one level produced 1.2). So `.browser-node__view` / the web node body KEEP
  `nowheel` — it prevents React Flow from taking a wheel packet over the page, and removing it
  cannot make an OOPIF event bubble. Main's one `web-contents-created` listener installs wheel and
  Cmd/Ctrl +/-/0 zoom only for `getType() === 'webview'`; the shared `WebviewZoomControls` calls the
  same 50%–300% policy for `WebNode` and `BrowserSurface`, which also covers the card modal. The app
  does NOT persist zoom in `project.json`: Electron propagates a zoom level by origin, so a per-node
  persisted value would make two nodes for one origin fight. Desktop: full; Server Edition:
  controls hidden (no Electron guest); Mobile: N/A (no canvas).
- **files** (`FilesNode.tsx`) — a file-manager node: ONE directory listing (`data.cwd`, persisted),
  pinned to the canvas beside the terminals working in it. Deliberately not a second Explorer: the
  drawer is a single tree rooted at the project cwd that covers the canvas, so it gives you one
  cursor and a lot of scrolling; several of these give you `src/renderer/nodes` next to the agent
  editing it and another on `docs/`. Navigate in place (breadcrumbs collapse deep paths but every
  crumb stays clickable), filter, create a file/folder, copy a path, reveal, and open a terminal in
  the folder shown (a `nodeterm:open-terminal` event, the sibling of `nodeterm:open-file`).
  - **It adds NO new IPC.** Everything runs on the existing `FsApi` (`list`/`mkdir`/`exists`/
    `write`) — which is why it works on Desktop, the Server Edition, an SSH project and a relay tab
    on day one; `mkdir`/`exists` are genuinely LIVE on a relay tab (see the Explorer bullet above —
    that line used to claim otherwise), so "New folder…" works there too. **Rename/move/delete are
    the deliberate v1 gap**: each needs a new leaf in `core/fs-ops`, an IPC channel, preload, the
    ws-bridge, `main/ssh-fs` (remote quoting) and the relay host-service, plus confirm dialogs and
    dangerous-path guards. That is a separate change with separate risk, not a corner to cut inside
    this one.
  - **Which filesystem** is `EditorNode`'s decision, read the same way: `data.sshFs` → the SSH
    project's host over the ControlMaster; otherwise the node's own SESSION api, which is the local
    core for a local project and the PEER's for a relay tab. Reading it off `useSession()` rather
    than `window.nodeTerminal` is the entire reason a relay tab browses the right machine.
  - **Opening is delegated, never reimplemented**: a file dispatches `nodeterm:open-file`, so
    editor-vs-video-vs-image routing stays in Canvas's one `openFile` and this node never grows a
    second opinion about what a `.png` is. `fileOpenTarget` decides only canvas-vs-OS, and a REMOTE
    listing never reaches the OS branch — `shell.openPath` opens a path on THIS machine. **The OS
    branch is now also gated on being ABLE to open locally**, not just on remoteness: `shell.openPath`
    is a documented `noop` in the Server Edition (`bridge/stubs.ts:180-186`), and a browser tab's own
    session `source` is `'local'` — `SessionSource` declares `'server'` but nothing ever constructs
    it (`session/session.ts:8`), so `source` alone can never tell you you're in a browser, only
    `isBrowserRuntime()` can. Opening a `.zip`/`.dmg` was therefore a silent dead click; closed by
    `canUseLocalShell` (`lib/download.ts`) — ONE predicate for every `shell.*` path action, with
    `canRevealLocally` kept as its older reveal-specific name so existing callers are untouched.
    Reveal was gated and openPath was not, and writing that rule twice is how they drifted.
  - **Two state bugs, both fixed.** (a) A directory a removed worktree took with it used to render
    as "This folder is empty." — not "Could not read this folder" — because `FsApi.list` is
    fail-open by contract (`core/fs-ops.listDir`/`SshFs.listDir` both end `catch { return [] }`, and
    the SSH IPC resolves `[]` even for a dead ControlMaster). `fs.exists` cannot disambiguate either:
    it's `stat`-based (true for a dir you can stat but not `readdir`), and on SSH its `false` can't
    separate "gone" from "the ControlMaster died" — the same conflation `SshFs.readTextChecked`
    (`main/ssh-fs.ts:164-176`) refuses, on the rule "a failed read is never evidence of absence". Now
    disambiguated by probing the PARENT's listing instead (`classifyEmptyListing`, pure,
    `lib/filesNode.ts` — the idiom `SshProjectDialog.tsx:112-125` and `file-links.ts`'s
    `makeDirListingLookup` already use), which answers `missing` / `empty` / `unreachable` /
    `unknown`. The parent CONTAINS the directory we are standing in, so it cannot legitimately be
    childless: an empty parent listing means we could not see it, which is `unreachable` and gets
    its own sentence naming both possible causes. That case used to answer `unknown` and render as
    "This folder is empty." over a dead ControlMaster, the commonest cause of an empty remote
    listing and the most reassuring possible lie. **`unknown` is reserved for the paths whose parent CANNOT answer** — a non-`/`-absolute cwd
    (an SSH project's `remoteCwd` defaults to **`~`**, where `parentDir` is `/` and `/` has no entry
    named `~`, so an empty remote HOME reported a deletion), a `.git` cwd (both listing legs strip
    it on purpose), and `.`/`..` segments; a case-folded match counts as present, for the
    case-insensitive filesystems where `readdir` answers with the on-disk spelling. `missing` must
    be the conclusion we are SURE of. Nothing is published until the verdict is in, so a deleted
    folder never flashes "empty" on its way to the error.
    (b) Nothing reset the list on navigation, so "Loading…" was reachable only on the very first
    mount — every later directory change showed the PREVIOUS directory's rows. Fixed by storing the
    listing WITH the cwd it belongs to, so a cwd change IS the loading state by construction; a
    re-list after a create deliberately keeps its rows (same directory, re-read).
  - The title tracks the folder only while `titleAuto` is unset — the same contract an agent node's
    session name uses, so navigating never overwrites a name the user typed.
  - A files node inside a REMOVED worktree is displaced like an editor, not like a terminal
    (`displacedByWorktree`): it has no session to disturb, so it is caught by path wherever it sits.
    The patch is the pure `displacedFilesPatch` (`lib/filesNode.ts`), where `null` means LEAVE IT
    ALONE on the dead path — the parent probe above then tells the truth — because
    `resetDisplacedCwd`'s fallback can be `undefined`, and writing that through would
    have cost the node the only thing it knows about itself. **The READ side is guarded too**: a
    files node with no `cwd` says so instead of falling back to `'/'` — `project.json` is
    git-shared, hand-editable input that nothing validates for this kind, so guarding only the
    writer left the silent root-browse reachable anyway. And `createFilesNode` places through
    `placeNode`, not `placeAt`, so snap-to-grid applies to its size as well as its position (React
    Flow resizes by adding a grid multiple to the START size, so an unsnapped box never lands on
    the grid later). The title
    rewrites alongside when `titleAuto` holds — the ONE cwd write that does not go through `navigate`.
  - **"New terminal here" was broken on BOTH remote kinds, and not by this node's own doing.**
    `addTerminal` resolves the project from `activeProjectId` and `createTerminalNode` does
    `cwd: ssh ? ssh.remoteCwd : cwd` (`state/workspace.ts`) — on an SSH project the folder on screen
    was silently DISCARDED and the terminal opened at the project root, a pre-existing hole in
    `addTerminal`'s `cwdOverride` contract affecting every caller, not just this one. Fixed by routing the call
    through the EXISTING `nodeSshFor`, which already carries this exact reasoning ("passing the
    project's ssh unchanged silently REPLACES the caller's cwd") and which `addTerminal` simply
    never used; it is handed `cwdOverride` and never the resolved `cwd`, because an SSH project can
    still carry a local `project.cwd` that `scmCwd` falls back to, and promoting that would root
    remote terminals at a path from the wrong machine. On a RELAY tab there is no `ssh` to
    rebind, so the row used to spawn a plain LOCAL terminal at the peer's remote path; it is now
    withheld there instead — spawning onto a peer's core is a real feature, not a one-liner.
  - Creation needs a project directory (`hasCwd`), and **the row degrades EXPLICITLY rather than
    vanishing** — disabled, carrying `FILES_NO_CWD_HINT` (an alias of `NEW_FILE_NO_CWD_HINT`), on
    the pane menu, the Dock and the sidebar "+". That is the rule #621 established for "New file…"
    and the SSH worktree row: a cwd-less project is a supported, persisted canvas, so a row that
    simply disappears takes its own reason with it while the fix ("Set folder…") sits one menu
    away. **⌘K is the deliberate exception** and hides the entry, exactly as main's "New file…"
    does — a disabled palette entry surfaces as a search result that does nothing, the same reason
    `sshAccountsHint` is omitted there. Inside a group frame it inherits a bound **worktree's** cwd
    via `cwdForNewNodeIn`, so a frame per branch also means a file tree per branch.
  - **A node kind not registered in `lib/reopenNode.ts` is a trap, and this one fell in it.** Every
    kind must sit in exactly one of `UNRESTORABLE` or a `buildBase` `case` — `files` was in neither,
    so ⇧⌘T recorded a snapshot (and a persisted `closedSessions` twin) that `buildBase`'s
    `default: return null` could never restore: a dead, clickable entry that compiles, typechecks and
    passes every test. `files` now has a `case` (it IS restorable — its whole state is the directory
    it shows), unlike `trigger`, excluded for the same missing-case reason
    (`reopenNode.ts:58-60`, the comment that made this findable). Two kinds have fallen in this trap
    now; treat registration as a checklist item for the next one.
  - **Kanban: deliberately not a card.** `canvas/toKanbanSession.ts` maps `browser`, `sticky` and
    `terminal` and returns `null` for everything else — cards do not "derive from terminal nodes",
    they derive from that explicit list. A files node has no session to co-attach and no text to
    edit; its value is spatial adjacency to the terminals working in the directory, which a column
    layout would discard.
  - `folderTitle` lives in `lib/explorerCreate.ts` (a zero-import leaf), not `lib/filesNode.ts`:
    `filesNode.ts` imports `isVideoFile` FROM `state/workspace`, so importing back would close a
    cycle. `filesNode.ts` re-exports it, so call sites are unchanged.
  - **The `/`-separator assumption is a KNOWN gap, shared with `explorerCreate`** (the Explorer
    drawer and canvas "New file…" already run on the same helpers) — `C:\x\y` reads as one segment.
    To be closed in ONE place for both, using the core-owns-the-dialect rule `terminal/file-links.ts`
    already implements. The TRAVERSAL half is closed: `newEntryPath` splits its `..` check on
    `[\\/]` and refuses a Windows-absolute name, because a guard that reads `\` as ordinary text is
    wrong about the machine that resolves the path. The construction half deliberately is not: on
    POSIX a backslash is legal filename text, so the join stays `/` and `weird\name.txt` is still
    one file. Guard on both dialects, construct in one.
  - **Mobile**: N/A — *nodeterm mobile* attaches to tmux sessions over the transport protocol and
    has no canvas or file-browsing concept; adding one means extending that protocol.
- **dino** (`DinoNode.tsx`) — a small self-contained T-Rex-style runner on a canvas (no PTY);
  high score persists via `data.highScore`.
- **trigger** (`TriggerNode.tsx`) — a canvas-owned schedule (cron / interval / once) that
  delivers a payload into a connected terminal/agent node when due (issue #493 — the inverse of
  the ephemeral loop/cron cards, which visualize AGENT-initiated recurrence). The card shows the
  schedule + next-run countdown, the target (a derived, never-persisted edge — the
  pending-launch dep edge is NO longer one: since the 2026-09-02 edge model it is a persisted rope,
  `ctrl-<dep>-<node>`, whose dashed ⏳ LOOK is what is derived), the payload, an honest
  ARMED/DISARMED/CHANGED/SET-UP chip with the
  "definitions travel with the repo, consent never does" narrative, Run-now, and the last runs
  (fired / delivered-late / queued / missed / failed / expired). Arming passes a ConfirmDialog
  showing the exact schedule+payload+target being consented to; all decisions are the pure,
  tested `lib/triggerCard.ts`, all state is host-side over `window.nodeTerminal.triggers`
  (arm/disarm/status/runNow — `startTriggerService` registers the handlers in BOTH shells;
  `runNow` deliberately takes no spec: a caller chooses WHEN, never WHAT). The relay stub
  refuses and the card says triggers are managed on the host. Mobile: N/A (no canvas).
- **subagent** / **loop** (`SubagentNode.tsx` / `LoopNode.tsx`) — render-only, hook-driven viz
  nodes, **never persisted**. `subagent` visualizes a subagent the Claude session spawned (type +
  task + live timer, expand for its live transcript — subagents have no PTY); `loop` shows a
  loop/schedule/cron kind + task + per-iteration summaries, Play re-issues the task into the parent
  terminal's tmux session.
- **chat** — **REMOVED 2026-07.** The SDK-driven Claude chat node (`ChatNode.tsx`, `main/chat-driver.ts`,
  the `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` dependency, and the whole chat-events/chatSessions stack) is
  gone — dropping the bundled SDK also removed a ~240 MB native binary per platform. A persisted `chat`
  node is migrated by `nodeStatesToFlow` into a **sticky tombstone** in place, carrying a
  `claude --resume <chatSessionId>` hint so the conversation continues in any terminal (a chat was an
  ordinary resumable Claude session). `CHAT_CAPABLE` / `canChat` survive but now gate **only** the
  ⌘M **ChatPanel** transcript view on a Claude *terminal* node (see the terminal bullet's Cmd/Ctrl+M),
  not any SDK chat node.

Monaco is wired in `renderer/editor/monaco-setup.ts` (language workers bundled via Vite
`?worker` — no CDN; CSP `worker-src` allows them). Markdown rendering is shared in
`renderer/lib/markdown.ts` (`marked` + DOMPurify sanitize). Terminal OUTPUT (the ⌘M output view)
goes through `renderer/lib/terminalOutputMarkdown.ts` instead: a private `Marked` instance with
`breaks` on (output is line-oriented — without it `ls -l` joined into one paragraph) that renders
raw-HTML tokens as escaped TEXT (a program's `<stdin>` is not markup; parsed as HTML, DOMPurify
stripped it) and trims capture-pane's trailing padding. The escape is on the `html` token, never a
global pre-escape of `<`, which would double-escape code spans/fences.

**A link in rendered markdown must never navigate the app window.** DOMPurify keeps an anchor's
href as written, and agents write relative links constantly (`[pty-manager.ts](src/core/pty-manager.ts:4100)`).
A click resolved it against the app document: on the desktop another `file://` path, which the old
`will-navigate` guard ALLOWED ("any `file://` is ours"), so the main window navigated to a file that
does not exist and the whole canvas was gone until a reload; in the Server Edition any `<a href>`
click, relative or http(s), navigated the app's own tab away. Two layers now:
- **Renderer, every surface** — ONE delegated, document-level click listener installed at boot
  (`renderer/lib/markdownLinks.ts`, from `boot.tsx`), scoped by `RENDERED_MARKDOWN_CONTAINERS`
  (`.term-md__content` — terminal ⌘M view + editor Preview, `.term-chat__text` — ChatPanel,
  `.sticky-node__md` — sticky notes on canvas AND in the kanban card modal). http/https/mailto →
  `shell.openExternal` (system browser / a new browser tab); `#fragment` and empty href → swallowed;
  anything else → swallowed + an error toast (`nodeterm:toast` — the only kind Canvas renders).
  Local links deliberately do NOT open a file: resolving one needs the owning node's cwd AND its
  filesystem dialect (session source, core platform, SSH/relay — TerminalNode's `pathConvention`),
  which a document-level handler cannot see; a wrong guess opens the wrong file on the wrong machine.
  **A new markdown surface must render inside a listed container** — `markdownLinks.test.ts` fails
  on a component that pipes `renderMarkdown` into `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` outside the list, and on
  a listed class nothing renders any more.
- **Main, desktop backstop** — `decideMainFrameNavigation` (`main/navigation-guard.ts`) allows a
  main-frame navigation ONLY to the entry document itself (scheme + host + decoded pathname; hash
  and query ignored, so reload and dev HMR work); a safe external scheme goes to the OS; everything
  else — any other `file://` path, any other dev-server path — is blocked.

### Webview keep-alive across project switches (browser/web nodes)

Issue #301: a project switch used to reload every browser node's page — SPA state, forms, scroll,
websockets gone — because the load effect swaps the whole React Flow node array and an Electron
`<webview>`'s guest process dies on DOM detach (a webview cannot be parked like xterm). The fix
keeps the ELEMENT mounted instead of trying to preserve anything through a remount. The facts it
rests on are measured (Electron 42.x probes + in-app verification, 2026-08-26):

- A guest **survives** sibling insert/remove around its element (React reconciliation of kept,
  order-stable keyed children never touches them), and **survives `display:none`** of itself or an
  ancestor — state intact, viewport size and scroll kept (the guest is NOT resized to 0), repaint
  pixel-identical on reveal, timers running throttled like a background tab.
- A guest **dies** on any DOM *move* (`insertBefore`/`appendChild` of an attached element detaches
  first), taking a full page reload with it. React moves a kept child exactly when its RELATIVE
  ORDER among kept children changes (`lastPlacedIndex`), and React Flow renders nodes in
  prop-array order keyed by id (`adoptUserNodes` rebuilds `nodeLookup` in array order) — so the
  merged prop's order discipline IS the feature.

Mechanics (`renderer/lib/webviewKeepAlive.ts` pure + tested, `state/webviewKeepAlive.ts` store,
merged in Canvas exactly like the ephemeral subagent cards — Canvas state, persistence, undo and
the wire never see any of it):

- Every webview-hosting node (`browser`/`web`) renders in ONE stable **pool region** at the tail
  of the `<ReactFlow>` nodes prop, ordered by the pool's entries; entry order never changes while
  an entry lives (append/remove only — `webviewKeepAlive.test.ts` pins the order-stability
  invariant, `webview-keepalive-reconcile.test.tsx` pins the no-detach consequence against real
  React). Visible cost of the hoist: an unselected browser/web node paints above other unselected
  z-0 nodes it overlaps (selection's z 1000 still wins).
- On switch-away the outgoing project's pages become **ghosts**: same node id, `display:none`,
  non-interactive, parked at the origin, `data.ghost` telling the surfaces to route facts at the
  pool (`updateGhostData`) instead of `updateNodeData`. On return the SAME element goes live
  again; `overlayKeepAliveData` folds ghost-time navigations into the loaded nodes inside the one
  `setNodes`, so the `url` prop never moves under the surviving surface (which would navigate it).
- **The merge is keyed on the MOUNTED project (`keepAliveFromRef`), never `activeProjectId`, and a
  mounted entry whose node is missing falls back to its ghost.** Both exist because the pool store
  (zustand/useSyncExternalStore), the ref and `setNodes` do not land in one commit: a switch renders
  interleavings where the id would otherwise drop out of the merged list for one commit — and one
  absent commit is an unmount, i.e. a dead guest ([MEASURED]: the ghost→live direction remounted
  every returning page until the fallback; live→ghost never did). A genuinely deleted node's entry
  is dropped at the deletion funnels (handleNodesChange's `remove`, `deleteNodes`, the peer-mutation
  remove, project deletion/prune), with the next retire as backstop — never by the merge.
- **The minimap must exclude ghosts from BOTH its node list and its bounds lookup** (#850/#786).
  React Flow's MiniMap ignores CSS `display:none`; setting `hidden` on the real node instead
  unmounts the guest. `canvas/VisibleMiniMap.tsx` projects the live flow store into a provider
  scoped to the map, preserving internal absolute positions, measured sizes and the original
  panZoom instance. Only the map's node collections are filtered; persistence and pool lifecycle
  are untouched. The real MiniMap regression tests cover ghost/live transitions, empty bounds,
  removals, grouped geometry and camera interaction. When upgrading React Flow, keep those
  tests: the projection deliberately mirrors the state fields consumed by MiniMap.
  **A pan/zoom frame takes a transform-only fast path**: when `transform` changed and the node
  collections did not, only the camera fields are copied and a full re-projection follows
  `MINIMAP_FULL_SYNC_DEBOUNCE_MS` after the move settles (rebuilding them per frame re-rendered
  every rectangle; measured 402 forced layouts per 20 s pan vs 1 with the map hidden). Identity
  checks alone cannot replace the full path: xyflow's `updateNodeInternals` mutates `nodeLookup`
  IN PLACE and then calls `set({})`, so any update that leaves `transform` alone syncs fully.
- **Memory bounds** (same posture as park/WebGL: a lever must not end live work): a ghost is
  hidden, so the existing Browser Memory Saver discards its guest after `BROWSER_DISCARD_MS`
  unless loading/audible/agent-driven — `onGuestDiscarded` then drops the entry (a husk would hold
  a cap slot). `BACKGROUND_WEBVIEW_MAX` (8) hard-caps live background guests, evicting
  longest-retired first; `activateProject` runs BEFORE `retireProject` on every switch so a
  returning page sheds its background clock before that eviction can pick it.
- E2E-verified under Xvfb (CDP): same webContents across Alpha→Beta→Alpha, typed form text + JS
  state + tick counter continuous, zero reloads; wrapper + webview DOM elements identity-stable in
  both directions. Server Edition: inert (no `<webview>` in a plain browser — ghosts are empty
  husks, nothing to preserve). Mobile: N/A (no canvas).

## Agent support (Claude / Codex / Gemini / Copilot / opencode / Grok / custom)

**Message scope publication:** desktop `send`/`reply`/`notify` wait for pending active-canvas edits
to be saved when either endpoint is on that canvas (`renderer/lib/messageScopeSync.ts`). `list`
and context links can already see a newly opened node while main's `persistedCanvases()` cannot;
the scope resolver reports that absent target as `cross-project`. The publication barrier never
travels, never overrides an external-edit conflict, and does not authorize anything: main still
checks unique project membership, runtime ownership, consent, verified status and the native pane.
An unrelated active canvas is not saved for a background message. Server control already writes
its nodes through the authoritative store; the renderer barrier is a desktop concern. Mobile is
not an agent-message sender.

The app is a pluggable multi-agent system: Claude Code is one builtin of
several. Extra terminal-node behavior is driven per agent by a registry + capability lists, a
shared 4-state model, and a **transient** zustand store `state/agentStatus.ts`
(`{state, agentId, unread, session, sessionId, loop, hibernated}` per node id; the live `state` is
**not** persisted — only `unread`/`session`/`sessionId`/`agentId`/`loop`/`hibernated` go to
localStorage under `nodeterm.agentStatus`, migrated once from the legacy `nodeterm.claudeStatus`
key. `agentId` is durable because a hand-launched `claude` in a plain terminal is known nowhere
else, and its context links must keep classifying across restarts).

- **Agent registry + capabilities** — `src/shared/agents/config.ts` holds `AGENT_CONFIG`
  (claude/codex/gemini/copilot/opencode/grok: id, label, spawn command, color, `promptInjectionMode`, …) keyed
  by an **open** `AgentId`
  type (so custom ids fit). Capabilities are membership lists, not flags:
  `AGENT_HOOK_TARGETS`, `RESUMABLE_AGENTS`, `SUBAGENT_CAPABLE`, `RECURRING_CAPABLE`,
  `BRANCH_CAPABLE`, `CONTEXT_LINK_CAPABLE`, `USAGE_CAPABLE`, `CHAT_CAPABLE`,
  `TRANSFER_SOURCE_CAPABLE`, `RENAME_CAPABLE`, `TITLE_READ_CAPABLE`, `CANVAS_CONTROL_CAPABLE`,
  `PERMISSION_MODE_CAPABLE`, `MODEL_SWITCH_CAPABLE`, with helpers (`hasHooks`,
  `canBranch`, `canContextLink`, `canChat`, `canRename`, `canReadTitle`, `hasPermissionMode`, …).
  Branch stays **Claude-only** purely by being in only `BRANCH_CAPABLE`. The ⌘M **ChatPanel**
  transcript view (`CHAT_CAPABLE` / `canChat`) is **claude + grok** since 2026-09: grok's
  `chat_history.jsonl` gets its own reader, and `chat:read-transcript` routes by agent. That list had
  to be SPLIT to do it — `CHAT_CAPABLE` carried two facts that coincided while claude was its only
  member ("we can render this" and "claude's resolver can locate and parse this file"), and the
  second now lives in `CLAUDE_TRANSCRIPT_READABLE` (claude only). Merging them back is a
  cross-session read of someone else's transcript; `config.capabilities.test.ts` pins the pair.
  The other lists span more agents, and the memberships below are the ones to check before assuming
  "claude-only" (all verified against `config.ts`, 2026-09-02): the per-node **context meter** is
  `USAGE_CAPABLE = claude/codex/gemini/grok` — grok states BOTH numbers, and its own percentage, in
  `signals.json`;
  the **permission mode** is `PERMISSION_MODE_CAPABLE = claude/grok/gemini/codex`; the session-name
  sync is **split in two** — `TITLE_READ_CAPABLE = claude/codex/grok/gemini` (read) ⊇
  `RENAME_CAPABLE = claude/grok` (write), because gemini and codex name their own sessions but have
  no rename command (codex's read leg is `readCodexSessionName`);
  **Context Link** spans five builtins
  (`CONTEXT_LINK_CAPABLE = claude/codex/gemini/opencode/grok`; the one builtin outside it is
  copilot). UI gates
  on these helpers — no hardcoded `=== 'claude'`. **Custom agents** (user-defined in Settings,
  `customAgents`) inherit the declared `baseAgent` harness through `capabilityAgentId`; a custom
  agent with no base remains spawn + terminal-title + process status only. Per-agent write-ups:
  **`docs/grok-agent.md`**, **`docs/gemini-agent.md`**, **`docs/copilot-agent.md`** (there is none for codex — its approval mapping
  and every value's reasoning live in `src/shared/agents/approval-mode.ts`);
  the distilled rules are **Adding a new agent** at the end of this section.
- **Model gateway / switcher** — `settings.modelGateway` stores one gateway root + a NON-SECRET
  credential reference: `${env:VAR}` for environment mode or
  `${secret:model-gateway-api-key}` for a literal held by `ModelGatewayCredentialService`. Desktop
  literal keys reuse the GitHub token store's safeStorage encryption / 0600 fallback; Server
  Edition uses the same generic 0600 atomic store. Legacy plaintext settings migrate only after
  the secret write succeeds. `shared/agents/model-gateway.ts` is the ONE mapping from a base
  harness to derived routes, env vars, compatible models and safely quoted model flags. Env
  expansion reuses `shared/agents/expansion.ts` and happens only in core against the host process
  environment; an unset reference fails closed instead of sending a token or partial credential.
  Discovery at `/v1/models` is the **OpenAI Models API convention**, implemented by both LiteLLM
  and Bifrost; the current `/openai/v1` + `/anthropic` launch-route derivation is Bifrost's layout,
  not the source of the discovery convention. Discovery sends the standard bearer header plus
  Bifrost's `x-bf-vk` header (needed by legacy, non-`sk-bf-` virtual keys), and runs in core
  (`agent:discover-models`) so browser CORS cannot block the Server Edition and the key never
  enters a terminal command. Support is a
  capability (`MODEL_SWITCH_CAPABLE = claude/codex/copilot`) resolved through `capabilityAgentId`, so a
  custom agent with a supported `baseAgent` inherits it automatically — the settings UI and canvas
  menu carry no agent allowlist. A model switch SIGTERMs the pane's foreground non-shell process
  group (never types `/exit`) and RECYCLES the tmux session before cold-resume: an existing shell may
  predate the gateway setting, and tmux env changes do not retroactively change that shell's
  environment. Recreating it guarantees the current URL/key applies without typing a secret into
  the pane. Ordinary Restart stays in-place. Custom-agent env is still merged last and may override
  the shared mapping. Desktop and Server Edition use the same core handler; relay tabs deliberately
  do not apply this machine's gateway to another core. Mobile needs a settings/model-picker surface
  before it can expose the feature.
- **Grok** (`@xai-official/grok` 1.0.0, builtin since 2026-08) — in `AGENT_HOOK_TARGETS`,
  `RESUMABLE_AGENTS`, `RENAME_CAPABLE`, `PERMISSION_MODE_CAPABLE`, `CANVAS_CONTROL_CAPABLE`,
  `CONTEXT_LINK_CAPABLE`, `CHAT_CAPABLE`, `TRANSFER_SOURCE_CAPABLE`, `USAGE_CAPABLE`,
  `SESSION_ID_CAPABLE` and `SUBAGENT_CAPABLE`. Subagent cards come from grok's native
  `SubagentStart`/`SubagentStop` hooks, keyed by `subagentId` — measured on 1.0.13 by launching two
  `explore` children in parallel (same type, different ids; the start's `sessionId` is the PARENT's,
  the stop's is the CHILD's own and equals `subagentId`, so that is the only id both events share).
  The spawn tool call is not the card key. The other four came off the blocked list
  in 2026-09, once a machine with a logged-in grok session produced real fixtures: context links and
  the ⌘M panel read `chat_history.jsonl` (NOT `updates.jsonl` — see below), and the meter reads
  `signals.json`. Its hook config is a **directory** (`$GROK_HOME/hooks/*.json`, all merged), so nodeterm
  **owns one file outright** (`nodeterm-status.json`) instead of merging into a shared settings file —
  which is also why a malformed copy of it is *healed* rather than preserved, locally and on an SSH
  host (`RemoteHooks.installGrokRemote`, under the host's own `$GROK_HOME`). Its dialect is
  **camelCase keys with snake_case event VALUES** (`{"hookEventName":"pre_tool_use"}`) — the SDK path
  flips the keys to snake_case, so `normalizeGrok` canonicalizes the event name and reads every field
  twice, and the shells share one decoder (`grokRawFields`). It carries **no `transcript_path`**, so a
  session directory is DERIVED from `cwd` + `sessionId` (`core/agents/grok-paths.ts`, the one
  `$GROK_HOME` rule — `core/usage/grok-usage.ts` delegates to it) and remembered in the shells' raw
  listener; the name read is `core/grok-session.ts` over `summary.json`, routed per agent by
  `core/agent-session-name.ts`. **The tool-event `matcher` is a regex: `.*`, never `*`** — a bare `*`
  is invalid and silently stops tool events firing (hence `ManagedHookEvent`). Grok also reads
  **`~/.claude/skills`** (Claude compat), which is why canvas control needed no new installer, and
  **`~/.claude/settings.json`**, so every grok event ALSO fires nodeterm's claude hook — an **inert**
  cross-fire (`normalizeClaude` finds neither grok's camelCase keys nor, in the SDK dialect, its
  lowercase event values), pinned by tests; canonicalizing claude's event-name compare would make it
  harmful. The `auto` permission-mode **version gate is claude's alone** (it is fed by a `claude
  --version` probe), and grok's mode flag must go **BEFORE** its `--` separator, which is
  end-of-options. Full picture, dialect traps and the device checklist: **`docs/grok-agent.md`**.
- **Gemini + codex parity** (2026-08-09) — brought both up to grok's level in the lists above. Unlike
  grok, **both CLIs are installed** and gemini **ships its own hook reference**
  (`/usr/lib/node_modules/@google/gemini-cli/bundle/docs/hooks/reference.md`), so almost every fact is
  measured. The load-bearing ones:
  - **Gemini's envelope IS claude-shaped** — `session_id`/`transcript_path`/`cwd`/`hook_event_name`
    (`reference.md:46-58`), the exact opposite of grok's missing `transcript_path`, so the shells just
    jail the path they are handed. The **event names** are gemini's own: eleven exist, `GEMINI_HOOK_EVENTS`
    subscribes **seven**. `AfterModel` is excluded because it fires **per streamed chunk**
    (`reference.md:236`) = one hook process per chunk; `BeforeModel` is **not** per-chunk (it fires once
    per request) and is excluded only because it reports nothing we render.
  - **`Notification` → `blocked`, matched as a CLOSED set** (`notification_type === 'ToolPermission'`).
    Before this, a gemini node sat on RUNNING while it waited for a permission answer. The closed match
    is measured, not cautious: gemini's `NotificationType` enum has exactly ONE member, and it fires
    only after `shouldConfirmExecute` returns details — i.e. only for a real dialog, so an
    auto-approved/`yolo` call fires nothing. **Grok's `includes('permission')` strobed on every tool
    call**; widening this "to be safe" is the unsafe direction.
  - **Context meter from each agent's own transcript** — one tail per agent, each with its own `parse`
    dep on `createContextTail` (`core/gemini-session.ts`, `core/codex-session.ts`), in **both** shells.
    Gemini: `tokens.input` and a window from `geminiWindowFor`, which mirrors the CLI's own
    `tokenLimit()` — a **family rule with a 1M catch-all default**, so an unknown model gets the right
    answer instead of a confident wrong denominator. Codex: `last_token_usage.input_tokens` and its own
    stated `model_context_window`. Two traps: `total_token_usage` is **CUMULATIVE** (would render a
    13%-full session at 79%), and `cached` is **INSIDE** `input` for both — while claude's input
    *excludes* cache reads, which is why claude sums them. **The formulas must not be unified.**
    The transcript jail is widened **per root** (`~/.gemini/tmp`, `<codexHome>/sessions`), never to
    `$HOME` — that predicate exists so a forged hook POST cannot aim a read at `~/.ssh/id_rsa`.
  - **`hasUsage` gated THREE features, not one.** Joining `USAGE_CAPABLE` also switched on
    `context.ensure` and the find bar's transcript index, both of which go through claude's
    `resolveTranscript` — whose **cwd fallback** then handed a codex node *the newest claude transcript
    for that cwd*: a stranger's session as its meter and its search hits. Gated by the pure
    `readsClaudeTranscript` (`renderer/lib/transcriptGates.ts`) rather than by a fourth list.
    `context.ensure` LEFT that gate in 2026-09 (issue #813) once its handler stopped *being* claude's
    resolver — see **Context-meter rehydration** below; the find bar's index still has no routing and
    so has not moved. The lasting rule is the one the episode taught: **grep every consumer of a
    helper before adding an id to its list**, and when two consumers need different answers, route
    the one that can be routed instead of widening the gate for both.
  - **`TITLE_READ_CAPABLE` was created here**: gemini names its own sessions through its `update_topic`
    tool (the title is in that call's `args.title`, NOT a top-level field) but has no rename command, so
    the read and write legs split. Its read path is the transcript the context tail already tracks
    (injected as `AgentSessionNameDeps.geminiPathFor`, held in a `let` in `src/main/index.ts` to avoid a
    TDZ throw that would kill a node's whole poll chain).
  - **In-place restart** works for gemini: `EXIT_SEQUENCES.gemini = '/quit'` — and it must stay **bare**,
    because `/quit --delete` exits *and permanently deletes* the session history, i.e. exactly what the
    restart exists to resume (pinned by its own test).
  Full picture, measurements, gaps and a device checklist: **`docs/gemini-agent.md`**.
- **Claude session context capacity (#818)** — the managed hook reports only
  `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS` from the effective Claude process environment (including
  `--settings` env), never the GUI/server process environment. HookServer validates decimal safe
  integers and verified node identity before passing optional `contextWindow` metadata to BOTH
  shells. Missing metadata means an older/unverified hook; explicit null means the current hook
  observed no valid override and clears the old observation. Local and SSH tails apply the exact
  per-session limit before the family estimate, including SMALLER limits; equal model ids do not
  share configuration. The renderer labels family fallbacks as estimates. Claude observations are
  not loaded from localStorage: `context.ensure` rehydrates usage, and until another verified hook
  observes the session env an idle Claude session has only an estimated window. No arbitrary
  endpoint fields, credentials, config-file reads or CLI commands are involved. A changed transcript
  starts fresh tracked state; unchanged hook observations never replay usage. Only `context.ensure`
  explicitly replays the live snapshot for a remounted consumer. Async reads from replaced/untracked
  entries cannot publish.
  Desktop and Server share validation; the SSH tail receives the remote hook's own env. Canvas and
  kanban share ContextMeter. Mobile's separate implementation needs the same provenance distinction.
  Gateway catalogue/accepted-launch work remains in #723/#725; this does not replace those PRs.
- **SSH context polling is a bounded byte protocol** (issue #816). The initial snapshot reads
  only the last 1 MiB and records the absolute end offset; subsequent polls process at most
  1 MiB. `core/remote-ssh/transcript-window.ts` measures size and uses block-aligned POSIX `dd`
  with base64, transferring less than 1.6 MiB including alignment/framing; idle replies contain
  only the size/range header. The encoded dd exit status must survive the shell pipeline:
  pipeline success alone can hide a failed read. Short/malformed replies and SSH failures throw,
  retain the cursor, and back off from 2s to 60s with payload-free diagnostics. A SEPARATE idle
  backoff (`idleDelayMs`) stretches the 1 s poll after three consecutive empty successful reads
  (2/4/8 s, capped at 10 s) and is reset by any data-bearing read and by every same-ref `track()`
  — i.e. every hook POST for the session, which is what keeps a `<task-notification>` (it rides
  a UserPromptSubmit hook) at ~1 s latency; never merge it with the failure backoff. Bootstrap and
  detected truncation restore usage without replaying historical task notifications/tool results,
  including a historical partial line completed later. A changed remote reference replaces its
  tracking generation so stale in-flight replies cannot publish. Server Edition uses the local
  core tail on its host (no SSH-project manager); mobile has its own direct-SSH implementation,
  so this desktop fix makes no claim about that separate path. Real `/bin/sh` fixtures cover
  >20 MiB idle files and a new notification split inside UTF-8; BSD/macOS SSH remains a device check.
- **Context-meter rehydration (`context:ensure`)** — the meter is fed by hook events, and a tmux
  session outlives the app, so a continuing session that is idle after a restart emits nothing and
  its meter stays blank until the user's next prompt. The mount-time read that exists to close that
  is `core/context-ensure.ts` (`registerContextEnsureIpc`), **in core so BOTH shells serve it** — it
  used to be inline in `src/main/index.ts` and the Server Edition had no handler at all, so a browser
  node's meter filled only on its next turn too (issue #813; the identical hole
  `core/transcript-ipc.ts` was moved to core to close). Three rules:
  - **It routes per agent; it does not widen a gate.** `agentId` picks that agent's OWN locator and
    tail — claude → `resolveTranscript`, codex → `locateCodex`, gemini → `locateGemini` (the last two
    keyed STRICTLY by session id, no cwd fallback, so neither can adopt a session that is not its
    own). A closed switch: an agent that is not in it gets **no meter**, never claude's resolver.
    That is what let the renderer gate move from `readsClaudeTranscript` to `showUsage` — the danger
    was never the meter, it was one resolver answering for four agents. **grok is deliberately
    absent**: its meter reads a `signals.json` whose directory is learned from a hook event, so after
    a restart there is nothing to rehydrate FROM (`locateGrok` resolves a different file, the
    conversation). Structural, not pending.
  - **A remote node is resolved on its HOST or not at all.** The desktop injects `ensureRemote`,
    which asks the host through `remoteTranscriptRefFor` — the ⌘M path's locator, jail
    (`isSafeRemoteTranscriptPath`) and cache, reused as a second consumer rather than copied. Its
    "could not resolve" is **terminal**: falling through to any local resolver would search THIS
    machine for a file that only ever existed on the other one, and claude's cwd fallback would
    happily meter an unrelated local session under the remote node's id. Remote Codex uses its own account-scoped locator and parser over the same bounded SSH
    reader. Its reported transcript window wins; Claude estimates must never supply a Codex
    denominator. Unresolved/disconnected remote nodes cannot fall through to local readers.
  - **Nothing negative is ever cached.** A clean miss and a failed ssh call are indistinguishable to
    the locator, so both cache NOTHING and the next mount retries in full — a momentarily dead
    ControlMaster must not be remembered as "this session has no transcript", or the meter stays
    blank until the next turn anyway, which is the bug arriving by another route. The only
    de-duplication is of **concurrent in-flight** calls (a canvas mounts dozens of remote nodes at
    once and each resolve is an ssh exec on someone else's machine); it releases on settle, so it is
    not a cache. **No timer** — one read at mount, the same rule Remote usage and session memory
    follow.
  Surfaces: Desktop full; **Server Edition** full and local-only (it runs ON the host whose
  transcripts it reads — the legitimate asymmetry, stated the way the SSH skip is); kanban card +
  card modal render the same `ContextMeter` from the same store and inherit it; mobile N/A (its own
  context display, separate path). Tests: `core/context-ensure.test.ts` (routing, remote
  fall-through, no negative cache) + `main/context-ensure-wiring.test.ts` (the shell's closure, at
  source level, because it closes over `ptyManager`/`sshProjectManager`).
- **Permission mode** (agents in `PERMISSION_MODE_CAPABLE` — claude, grok, **gemini**, **codex**) —
  the mode a session **starts** in (`claude --permission-mode <mode>`; Shift+Tab still cycles it at
  runtime). Membership no longer implies claude's flag spelling: **the per-agent translation lives in
  `src/shared/agents/approval-mode.ts`** (`approvalFlags` / `modeSupported`), which is also where
  `withPermissionMode` now lives — it moved one layer up out of `config.ts` to break a cycle.
  gemini = `--approval-mode default|auto_edit|yolo|plan`, codex = `--ask-for-approval
  on-request|never` (and `untrusted` too, but only on a codex that still has it — see the next
  paragraph). Two rules the mapping exists to enforce: a mode the CLI **cannot
  express emits NO flag**, never a substituted nearest match (codex has no `plan` and no
  edit-specific mode; **gemini has no `auto`** — nothing in its vocabulary means "approve most things
  but not edits", and since `auto` is the DEFAULT mode, mapping it to `auto_edit` would have switched
  auto-approve-edits on for every existing gemini node at upgrade time, silently), and "supports"
  must not be a lie either — codex's `manual` maps to
  `untrusted` because its built-in default is `OnRequest` (measured: `codex doctor`, no `approval`
  key in `~/.codex/config.toml`), so leaving it unflagged would deliver "the model decides when to
  ask" under an "Ask each time" label. **codex is the first agent where `manual` emits a flag.** The
  UI copy is DERIVED from the mapping (`permissionModeAgentIds` / `permissionModeAgentsLabel` /
  `unsupportedModesNote` / `bypassSandboxCaveat`) so a sentence cannot drift from what the table
  does — so the note now reads "Auto has no Gemini equivalent…" beside codex's gaps, and the
  residual wart is only that `auto` and `manual` land on the same gemini policy (the *prompting* one).
  `--sandbox` is a separate axis and deliberately untouched (`--ask-for-approval never`
  still sandboxes).
  **AN AGENT'S VOCABULARY IS NOT A CONSTANT — codex's moved, and the table is gated on a probe of
  the binary in front of us (#785).** Measured release by release on the published linux-x64
  binaries: 0.146.0 / 0.147.0 / 0.148.0 advertise `untrusted, on-request, never`; **0.149.0**
  through 0.154.0 advertise `on-request, never`. clap does not ignore a value it does not know, it
  prints `error: invalid value 'untrusted'` and **exits**, so a Manual-mode Codex node launched from
  the pinned table died at the prompt and left the pane at a bare shell. The gate is codex's OWN and
  sits beside claude's, never inside it (a gate fed by `claude --version` belongs to claude):
  **`core/codex-cli.ts`** reads `codex --help` once per app run — FEATURE-detected, not
  version-compared, because a floor guesses about builds that are not on npm — parses the option's
  own slice with `codexApprovalValuesFrom` (the neighbouring `-s, --sandbox` carries its own
  `[possible values: …]` two lines up, and a page-wide scan emits `--ask-for-approval read-only`),
  and publishes `CodexCliCaps` over `codex.cliCaps()`, registered by **both** shells. Every emitter
  threads it as `ApprovalCaps` — `approvalFlags` / `modeSupported` / `withPermissionMode` /
  `unsupportedModesNote` all take an optional trailing `caps`, and the **omitted** form resolves to
  the BASELINE `['on-request','never']`, the two values every measured codex accepts. That default
  is the design: a call site that forgets to thread its probe result loses a mode, never a launch.
  On 0.149.0+ `modeSupported('codex','manual')` is **false** and the derived note says so —
  measured before concluding it: `-a unless-trusted` is refused, `-c approval_policy=untrusted`
  fails config load, and `--approve-for-me` routes approvals through *automatic* review. **Remote is
  unknown, never guessed**: an SSH node runs the HOST's codex and there is no remote codex probe yet
  (claude has one, at connect), so `codexApprovalCaps(ssh)` and the mirror's SSH slice publish
  nothing and fall to the baseline. Same for a relay tab (the guest's machine) — its stub answers
  unknown on purpose. Three surfaces: **Desktop** and **Server Edition** both probe their own
  machine (the server's `registerCodexCliIpc` is REAL, unlike its deliberately-false
  `registerCodexIdentityIpc`); **Mobile** gets the vocabulary as `MirrorSettings.codexApprovalValues`
  — the desktop/server now publish it, the iOS reader is the follow-up. The app-server **usage
  tier** (`usage/codex-usage.ts`) carried the same dead `-a untrusted` and silently returned null on
  every current CLI; it is now `-a never` with **no probe**, because `never` is in both vocabularies
  (measured against 0.148.0 / 0.151.0 / 0.154.0) and `-s read-only` is what actually guards the
  user's files.
  `settings.claudePermissionMode` (global, default **`auto`** — a behavior change for existing
  users, who previously got a prompt per action) is overridden per project by
  `project.defaultPermissionMode` (persisted to `.nodeterm/project.json`, so a `bypassPermissions`
  override travels to everyone who clones the repo — the tab menu warns). Modes are
  `manual | auto | acceptEdits | plan | bypassPermissions`, labelled once in
  `PERMISSION_MODE_LABELS` (from which `ALL_PERMISSION_MODES` is derived — the dropdown and the
  validator can't desync). `resolvePermissionMode(project, settings)` is the resolver
  (`renderer/state/permissionMode.ts` `activePermissionMode(agentId)` binds it to the live stores **and
  applies the version gate below — for `agentId === 'claude'` only**), and
  **`withPermissionMode(cmd, agentId, mode)` is the single
  funnel through which every agent-node launch site appends the flag** (new node, cold-restore
  resume, Branch, handoff/transfer, explain-commit, add-agent, canvas-control open-agent + team
  spawn). **WHERE the flag lands is decided at the composed layer** (`createAgentNode`), not in
  `withPermissionMode`: with no `argvPromptSeparator` (claude) it goes LAST, keeping the historical
  command byte-identical; with one (grok's `--`) it must go **BEFORE** the separator, because `--` is
  end-of-options and a flag after it is a positional — silently swallowed into the prompt or a clap
  usage error. Assert that at `createAgentNode`; a `withPermissionMode` test passes while the composed
  line is wrong. (gemini and codex declare no separator, so their flag goes last and their command
  lines stay byte-identical; grok is still the only agent taking the other branch.)
  UI: Settings → Agents, and the tab ⌄ menu for the per-project override.
  **Version gate (`auto` only) — CLAUDE's alone:** `--permission-mode auto` exists only in **Claude Code ≥ 2.1.71**;
  older CLIs validate the value against their own choices list and **exit 1** — and `auto` is the
  default, so an ungated flag would kill every Claude launch on an older CLI. So the CLI is probed
  (`core/claude-cli.ts` → `claude --version`, memoized, registered on `CorePlatform` so **both**
  shells serve it; reached from the renderer via `window.nodeTerminal.claude.cliCaps()`, with a
  **real** ws-bridge implementation) and `gatePermissionMode(mode, autoSupported)` degrades **only
  `auto`**, and only to `manual` = **no flag** = the bare pre-feature command. Everything **fails
  open**: unknown/unreadable version, a probe that failed or hasn't answered yet ⇒ bare command,
  never a blocked launch; the other four modes are never touched by the gate, and the user's
  *setting* stays `auto` (only the emitted command line changes). **SSH projects** are gated on the
  **remote** host's CLI, never the local one: `SshProjectManager.connect` probes `claude --version`
  on the host (through a login shell — an ssh exec channel's rc file usually bails out early — with
  `$HOME/.local/bin` + `$HOME/.claude/local` prepended to PATH: the official installer targets
  `~/.local/bin`, which a stock root `.profile` never adds, so a host whose interactive shells run
  claude fine still probed "not found" and silently degraded `auto` to manual) and
  caches the answer on the connection → `useSshConn`; not connected / not yet probed ⇒ no `auto`
  flag. A FAILED remote probe (claude not found — often a transient login-shell hiccup) **retries
  on a bounded backoff** (`PROBE_RETRY_DELAYS_MS`; every attempt pushes its answer immediately so
  launch waiters never block on the retry tail; a definite version — old or new — never retries),
  and the status event carries `remoteClaudeVersion` (`null` = probe failed) beside the boolean.
  The cold-restore relaunch `await`s the (shell-warmed) local probe because it fires on mount —
  and on an SSH project whose resolved mode is `auto` it also waits (`SSH_AUTO_PROBE_WAIT_MS`,
  bounded, fail-open) for the REMOTE probe's first answer, which races the same mount. Because
  the degrade is silent by design, the tab menu's Auto rows surface it: `sshAutoModeHint`
  (tri-state `useSshConn.autoPermAnswer` + probed version) puts a ⚠︎ + tooltip on "Auto" / "Use
  global (Auto)" for an SSH project whose remote CLI is too old / missing / not yet probed.
  **Security:** mode values come from hand-editable, git-shared JSON and end up interpolated into
  a shell command line (tmux `send-keys`), so `permissionModeFlag` **re-validates** the mode at the
  interpolation site (the type is compile-time only) — an unrecognized mode yields **no flag**, i.e.
  the bare, safe command. `'manual'` likewise yields no flag, reproducing the pre-feature command
  bit-for-bit. The setting and the per-project override apply to **terminal (CLI) agent nodes only**
  (the SDK **chat node**, which never honored it, was removed 2026-07). **No other agent inherits this
  gate:** grok has accepted every mode since 1.0.0 and gemini/codex accept theirs on the versions we
  measured, so gating any of them on a `claude --version` probe would
  downgrade their sessions on a machine whose claude is old or absent — `activePermissionMode` gates
  only `'claude'`, `ensureActivePermissionMode` awaits the probes only for `'claude'`, and
  `sshAutoModeHint`'s copy names Claude in every sentence for the same reason. An agent needing its
  own gate adds one beside claude's.
- **State via each agent's hooks → shared 4-state model** — detection uses the agent's own
  hooks, **not** output parsing. `src/shared/agents/normalize.ts` has per-agent normalizers
  (`normalizeClaude`/`normalizeCodex`/`normalizeGemini`/`normalizeCopilot`/`normalizeOpencode`/`normalizeGrok`) that map each agent's native hook
  events to a `NormalizedAgentEvent` over the shared `AgentState` (`working | waiting | blocked
  | done`) plus subagent/recurring/session kinds. Canvas's listener consumes
  `NormalizedAgentEvent` from `agent:status`, drives the `agentStatus` store, fires throttled
  (5s/node) background notifications, and records the session id. Header shows a pulsing
  **RUNNING** (working) / **NEEDS YOU** (waiting/blocked) badge.
- **DROPPED — the CLI died and nobody told us** (`renderer/terminal/agent-liveness.ts`, issue #616).
  Every ORDERLY exit announces itself: Eco's `/exit` sets `hibernated`, "Pause session" sets
  `paused`, and a user typing `/exit` fires the CLI's own SessionEnd, which `setState(id, undefined)`
  records. A KILL announces nothing — the process is gone before it can run a hook, and tmux's shell
  still owns the pane so the PTY never closes. The node therefore kept rendering its last badge over
  a dead conversation, with the CLI's parting `Resume this session with: claude --resume <uuid>` and
  a stray `^[%` in the pane as the only evidence. Not exotic: measured on the reporting host
  (2026-09-04) 62 GB RAM with swap fully consumed, kernel `oom_kill` at 187, 147 live `claude`
  processes holding 44 GB. The signal is `#{pane_current_command}` reading as a shell while the
  status table still believes an agent is parked there, and the four refusals are the feature:
  a `null` pane read is NEVER evidence (a downed ControlMaster must not make a canvas of healthy
  remote nodes claim they died); `hibernated`/`paused` are our own exits and already have chips;
  **only `done`**, never `working` — a turn in flight is exactly when a tool subprocess can own the
  pane's foreground, so the alarm would fire on a healthy agent running a shell command; and the
  agent must be in **`SESSION_END_CAPABLE`**. That last list is the false-positive gate and is
  DERIVED from `normalize.ts`, not chosen: exactly four normalizers map `sessionPhase: 'end'`
  (claude, gemini, copilot, grok) and **codex and opencode map none**, so on those two a deliberate
  `/quit` and an OOM kill leave byte-identical evidence and the chip would be a coin flip shown as a
  fact. Adding an id without first adding its normalizer branch puts a chip on every session its
  owner quit on purpose — `agent-liveness.test.ts` asserts the list against that source. The verdict
  (`agentStatus.dropped`) is TRANSIENT, a stronger call than the other clocks: it is a claim about a
  pane, panes are re-measurable in milliseconds, and a persisted one would strand a stale chip on a
  node someone resumed by hand. ANY hook event withdraws it — the one self-heal that deliberately
  does not gate on `alive`, since `done` disproves "there is no CLI in this pane" even though it must
  not clear `hibernated`. Cost is bounded by asking only for a node that is BOTH watched and already
  believed to be a parked agent. Resume reuses the hibernation wake closure unchanged, which
  re-reads the pane and refuses anything that is not a shell. Chip on the node header, the kanban
  card and the card modal; Desktop and Server Edition identical; relay tabs answer `null` and are
  never judged. **A second thing this catches, unplanned:** in the same sweep 9 of 149 panes sat at a
  bare shell because a cold-restore `--resume` had answered *"No conversation found with session
  ID"* — the persisted `sessionId` outlived its transcript. The chip surfaces those too, but the
  Resume it offers still replays that dead id — but cold restore no longer creates the state: it
  probes `transcript:exists` first and launches bare on a positive `absent`, saying so on the node
  (see **Cold restore** above). Re-measured on the same host 2026-09-09: **20** of 108.
- **Hook server (loopback HTTP)** — `src/core/agents/hook-server.ts` is a main-process
  loopback HTTP server (per-session bearer token, fail-open) that the installed hook scripts
  POST to; it replaced the old `fs.watch` signal-log mechanism. `buildPtyEnv` injects the
  node id + endpoint/token into each spawned session's env; because tmux sessions **outlive
  the app**, the server also writes `<userData>/hook-endpoint.env` so a relaunched main
  process re-advertises the same endpoint (restart handoff). A `setRawListener` channel feeds
  the per-node context-window meter (`context-tail.ts` — **one tail per agent**, each with its own
  `parse` dep: claude's usage records, `codexContextParse`, `geminiContextParse`) and the subagent
  live-transcript (`subagent-tail.ts` — claude via meta-dir `track`, codex via `trackFile` with the
  stateful `codex-subagent-format.ts` formatter). The same events feed the **agent-status mirror**
  (`core/agent-status-mirror.ts`) the mobile companion reads; the mirror carries an optional
  `settings` block (`claudePermissionMode`/`autoSupported`/`claudeAccounts`) so the phone can
  launch agents with the desktop's permission mode + managed accounts, and SSH slices get their
  **per-host** settings (remote CLI caps + host-matched accounts) injected via
  `remote-status-push`'s `settingsFor` dep.
- **Hook installers** — `src/core/agents/hooks/` holds per-agent hook services + an installer
  registry `MANAGED_HOOK_INSTALLERS`. `managed-script.ts` builds the POSIX hook script that
  POSTs to the server (env-gated: a no-op in the user's normal terminals, active only in
  sessions nodeterm spawns; the `claude-signals` string is kept as the idempotency marker that
  migrates users off the old hook). claude → `~/.claude/settings.json` and gemini →
  `~/.gemini/settings.json` (shared `install-helper.ts`, merged/idempotent, preserving other
  tools' hooks); codex → `~/.codex/hooks.json` + `~/.codex/config.toml` trust entries
  (`codex-trust.ts` — the hash gates whether codex runs the hook); **grok → our OWN file
  `$GROK_HOME/hooks/nodeterm-status.json`** (its hook config is a directory whose files are all
  merged, so there is nothing of the user's inside ours — which is also why a malformed copy is
  *healed*, not preserved, on both the local and the SSH path). The per-event **`matcher`** the grok
  installer needs is why events are typed `ManagedHookEvent` (`string | {event, matcher}`): grok's
  tool matcher is a REGEX and must be `.*` — a bare `*` is invalid and silently stops tool events
  firing. Plain-string events keep their byte-identical output for every other agent.
  **Codex is the one agent whose hook command is NOT a POSIX one-liner on Windows** (issue #567):
  it builds the command as `cmd.exe /C <string>` (`codex-rs/hooks/src/engine/command_runner.rs`,
  rust-v0.151.0) unless the session has a shell configured, which a default Windows install has
  not — so `if [ -x '…' ]; then …; fi` answered `-x was unexpected at this time.` and **exit 1 on
  every event**, for the life of the node. Claude is fine there only because Claude Code runs its
  hooks through Git Bash. The fix is a batch entry point (`codex-hook.cmd`,
  `codex-windows-wrapper.ts`) written beside `codex.sh` and named by `buildManagedCommand`'s win32
  branch; it **locates a POSIX shell and runs the same script** — deliberately not a second
  implementation of the hook protocol, which would be two copies of the POST/failover/token/
  permission-poll to drift. Three rules it must keep: pass stdin through, DRAIN stdin on every bail
  (codex writes the payload there; #186/#187), and exit 0 when there is no shell or no script.
  Two traps around it: `buildManagedCommand`'s `platform` is the platform of the machine that will
  RUN codex, so `RemoteHooks.installCodexRemote` passes POSIX explicitly (a Windows desktop must not
  put a `.cmd` command on a Linux host); and `isManagedCommand` matches **both** leaves
  (`codex.sh` AND `codex-hook.cmd`) on every platform — matching only the local one would leave a
  pre-fix entry unrecognized, so the fresh one is appended beside it, which is #558 on a second
  file. Matching both is what REPAIRS an existing Windows install at the next launch. **Both
  sides of the managed-entry match go through `normalizeHookCommand`** — the marker used to be
  folded to `/` while the stored command was compared raw, so on Windows nodeterm never recognized
  its OWN entry and appended a fresh set every launch (#558: nine copies of nine events, nine
  `claude.sh` processes per Stop, nine 45 s `PermissionRequest` waits racing one prompt). Because
  `mergeManagedHook` drops every managed entry before pushing one fresh, the corrected match IS the
  repair for a file already ruined — it runs at boot via `installManagedAgentHooks` and, being the
  ONE shared merge, heals claude/gemini/grok, every managed Claude account dir and all three SSH
  remote installers at once; a second repair mechanism would be exactly the duplicated rule this
  file warns about. It strips only OUR handler out of a definition, so a hook a user hand-merged
  beside ours survives.
- **A reused ControlMaster is not evidence of a live hook tunnel** (issue #735 — remote sessions
  stuck on **Unknown**, no completion notifications, no unread dots). `connect()`'s reuse branch
  returned the cached `hookEndpointPath` whenever `ssh -O check` answered, on the written-down
  assumption that *"a master that answered `-O check` never lost its tunnel"*. That is false, and
  the mechanism is **our own self-heal**: `childArgs` uses `ControlMaster=auto` + `ControlPersist`
  precisely so a dead master is rebuilt by the next child command (a status poll, a mirror push, a
  remote git call) on the same ControlPath. The rebuilt master answers `-O check` — and carries no
  `-R`, because `RemoteHooks.setup()` is the only caller of `hookForwardArgs` and it runs only on
  the branch where a master has just come up. The 45 s watchdog then parks on the reuse branch
  forever. Nothing reports it: the project says `connected`, terminals work, the mirror pushes, and
  only the hook POSTs die — into a socket file that still EXISTS with nobody listening.
  **MEASURED on the host that prompted the fix**: 10 per-project hook sockets on disk, exactly ONE
  with a listener (`ss -lxp`); the dead project's socket answered `curl` exit 7 while that same
  project's status mirror was being written the same second; **107 of 128** live `nodeterm-rmt`
  tmux sessions were pinned to that dead endpoint. Sessions are pinned for life
  (`new-session -A -e …` — tmux ignores `-e` on an existing session), so every one of them stayed
  dark until the app restarted. The reuse branch now probes the tunnel (`RemoteHooks.tunnelAlive`,
  one `curl` over the already-multiplexed master) and re-runs the idempotent `setup()` when it does
  not answer, firing `onTunnelVerified` so the working agents resync. **The retry is backed off**
  (`tunnel-repair.ts`, pure + tested): the FIRST failure repairs immediately — that is the common
  case — while a host that can never forward (`AllowStreamLocalForwarding no`, no `curl`, a `$HOME`
  the validator refuses) settles at one attempt per 15 minutes instead of rewriting every agent's
  hook config every 45 s. A missing spec answers "not alive" rather than "unknown": nothing of ours
  is bound, which is a tunnel that cannot deliver.
- **The per-agent hook installs run CONCURRENTLY, and the order that still matters is the one above
  them.** `RemoteHooks.setup()` is the chain `connectOnce` awaits before a project reports
  `connected`, so every terminal of a switched-to project waits through it. Its shape was: resolve
  `$HOME`, open + VERIFY the reverse tunnel, write the endpoint file — and then install five agents'
  hooks strictly one after another, ~16 more remote round trips in a row. MEASURED against a real
  sshd through a 25 ms one-way delay proxy (50 ms RTT), 5 runs each: **3281 ms serial → 1471 ms
  concurrent** over the same 22–24 ssh children. The installers are independent by construction —
  each writes its own script under `<remoteDir>/agent-hooks/` and merges its own agent's config; no
  two touch the same remote path, and the only shared statement is an idempotent `mkdir -p` — and
  the `SshChildGate` (cap 6 per ControlMaster) is what makes the fan-out safe against a stock host's
  `MaxSessions`, which is the whole reason it exists.
  - **The tunnel and the endpoint file stay strictly BEFORE the fan-out**: that file is what every
    hook this installs POSTs through, and it is written only once the tunnel has verified end to
    end. `remote-hooks.test.ts` pins that ordering AND the overlap (a gated fake runner, so
    concurrency is observed rather than inferred from wall-clock; the overlap test fails on the
    serial version, checked by mutation).
  - **`allSettled`, not `all`.** By the fan-out the tunnel is verified and the endpoint written, so
    one installer failing must cost that agent its hooks and nothing else — not discard a working
    setup for every other agent, which is what a rejection propagating to `setup`'s outer catch
    would do (`return null` ⇒ no hooks at all, and post-#735 a repair retried on backoff forever).
    Every installer catches its own errors today; this is the guard for the next one that forgets.
  - The claude/gemini loop body became `installJsonAgentRemote`, with the same fail-open try/catch
    its three siblings already had. Its three steps stay strictly ordered inside: the merge reads
    the file the write then replaces.

**Command-bearing terminal opens (issue #653):** the shared hook-server route requires verified
node identity whenever `open-terminal` carries `cmd`, including an empty value or a dry run.
The strict-policy override and foreign-instance fallback cannot release this gate. Desktop plain
terminal opens keep their existing identity policy; Server Edition still requires verification
for every control verb. Legacy mobile/SSH callers must present this instance’s node token for
command-bearing opens; this does not add a human-confirm dialog or change mobile transport APIs.

- **Per-node hook identity** (`src/core/agents/node-auth-*.ts`, `node-token-*.ts`,
  `node-identity-policy.ts` — full write-up in **`docs/node-identity.md`**) — the shared bearer proves
  "a session on this machine", never *which* session, so every node also gets a capability derived
  from one restart-stable secret (`kid.mac`, domain-separated HMAC over the node id), handed to the
  client as a 0600 file and verified three ways: `verified` / `legacy` / `forged`. `legacy` is "we
  cannot judge this", not a failure. Two invariants come out of this series and both cost real
  incidents to learn:
  - **A credential never rides argv — local or SSH.** Measured 2026-08-13: `buildPtyEnv` put the hook
    bearer in the tmux `-e` argv, which lands in a long-lived tmux client's `/proc/<pid>/cmdline`
    at **mode 444** on a stock Linux with no `hidepid`; combined with `open-terminal --cmd` not being
    in the confirm-gated `DESTRUCTIVE` set, that was arbitrary command execution as the victim from
    any account on the box. A remote command line is argv on **both** ends, so the same rule binds
    every `ssh`/`curl` we generate. Credentials travel by 0600 file or by **stdin**
    (`curl --config -`, already house style in `usage/remote-claude-usage.ts` and
    `codex-identity-proxy.ts`). Never add an argv fallback "for old curl" — that undoes the fix.
  - **Both raw listeners change together** — `src/main/index.ts` and `src/server/agent-status.ts`.
    A new field on the hook event (the `verified` flag was one) that reaches only the desktop leaves
    the Server Edition silently without the feature; the boundary tests cannot tell you a field is
    *missing*. `hook-verified-parity.test.ts` asserts it at source level because this repo has
    shipped a one-shell hook-server change three times.
  - **Every generated sh client reads the token through ONE resolver** (`nt_read_node_token`,
    `core/agents/node-token-sh.ts`) — the managed hook script, `nodeterm.sh` and `context.sh`. The
    token dir is advertised only by the endpoint FILE, and a session is pinned for life to the
    endpoint PATH it got at tmux creation, so a client that reads only what that file advertises
    presents nothing forever when the file is pre-v2 (SSH hosts' shared `~/.nodeterm/hook-
    endpoint.env`, whose per-project socket path is re-bound on every connect, so it stays LIVE) or
    unreadable (a phone-spawned session). Issue #384: the hook script FAILS OVER and re-reads the
    token from the endpoint it adopts, the two shims did neither — so the same node proved itself
    through one client and was refused through the other by the trust-on-first-proof latch, for the
    life of the session. The resolver falls back to `<dir of the endpoint file>/node-tokens` (the
    layout by construction on all three surfaces) and then the well-known data dirs; it is monotone
    — advertised dir first, keyed by node-id filename in every candidate, and a foreign instance's
    dir yields a foreign `kid` = `legacy` = exactly what presenting nothing already gave.
  - **Every LOCAL generated sh client recovers shared-Codex identity before its env gate.** A tool
    shell forked by the account-scoped app-server carries `CODEX_THREAD_ID`, not the pane's
    `NODETERM_*`. Managed hooks, local `nodeterm.sh`, and local `context.sh` therefore prepend
    `codexThreadIdentityResolverSh(codexThreadIdentityRoot())` before testing
    `NODETERM_NODE_ID`/`NODETERM_CANVAS_CONTROL`. Before this was shared, status hooks recovered the
    node while both user-facing shims declared that same first-class Codex session outside
    nodeterm. The SSH constants remain machine-neutral: the local record root is not valid on a
    remote host and must never be baked into its copy — enforced by
    `main/remote-ssh/remote-shim-neutrality.guard.test.ts`, two legs (the exported neutral bodies
    carry no record root or prelude, and `remote-hooks.ts` cannot even NAME a parameterised
    builder), because the failure is silent and one-sided: a remote shim carrying the prelude keeps
    working, and the only symptom is this machine's userData layout sitting in a file on someone
    else's server. **The prelude is shared; the RECORD it reads is desktop-only.** Those writers are
    the two hook-server handlers `src/main/index.ts` registers — and, since the daemon-reset work,
    the ones `wireServerCodexSharedIdentity` (`src/server/codex-shared-identity.ts`) registers at
    Server Edition boot as well. That shell used to answer a flat `shared: false`
    (`UNKNOWN_CODEX_IDENTITY_CAPS`) as a DELIBERATE degrade: its Codex nodes ran their own
    app-server, so no tool shell needed recovering. It no longer does. The Server Edition has the
    same local app-server, the same signed node tokens and the same persistent canvas store, so it
    wires the shared-thread spine **after** those secrets exist and its panes get the same
    supervisor. The registration is deliberately late for that reason, and `registerCodexIdentityIpc()`
    now answers from the live resolver instead of a constant — an early browser caller waits for the
    refresh rather than being pinned to a false "plain Codex" answer for the whole app run. What
    remains desktop-only is the record's REMOTE leg (SSH shims carry no record root or prelude, the
    paragraph above).
  - **That prelude EXPORTS WHAT THE RECORD SAYS — it never decides.** `NODETERM_AGENT_ID` and
    `NODETERM_CANVAS_CONTROL` were once constants there (`codex`, granted); both are
    `buildPtyEnv`'s answers about the PANE, which labels a node with its OWN agent id
    (`custom:<uuid>` for a custom agent whose `baseAgent` is codex, not `codex`) and gates the grant
    on `canControlCanvas`. The constants therefore mislabelled every custom codex-based node and
    asserted a grant that agrees with the pane only because
    `SHARED_IDENTITY_CAPABLE ⊆ CANVAS_CONTROL_CAPABLE` — a coincidence that list's own comment
    invites the next shared-identity agent to break, and breaking it hands a tool shell a capability
    its pane was denied. So the record carries `agentId` + `canvasControl` INSIDE the 6-tuple HMAC,
    and the prelude reads them; the grant is exported only when the record grants it and is left
    UNSET otherwise (absent, never `0` — the shape both shims' `[ -z … ]` gates expect). The **pane
    echoes its own label** on `/codex-thread/{start,bind}` (a tmux session outlives the app, so
    after a restart nothing server-side still knows what agent a node runs), but the **grant is
    never echoed**: the route derives it with `canControlCanvas`, so there is ONE decider and a
    forged id cannot manufacture a grant the table refuses. The three preimage generations are
    **selected by the record's shape, never tried in turn** — a record naming an agent must not
    verify under a preimage that ignores one — and a pre-agent record's implied `codex` + grant is
    keyed on the LINE being absent, never on the value being empty, so nothing that names an agent
    falls back to the guess. The env vars were never a security boundary in any case (anyone who can
    run the shim can `export` them by hand); the per-node token is, and
    `docs/shared-codex-node-identity.md` states that argument in full.
  - **A shell that forwards this identity cannot be type-checked into correctness.** A handler that
    destructures the request without `agent`, and a record write that omits its optional trailing
    argument, are BOTH well-typed — so the whole dimension can be plumbed through core, the route,
    the launcher and the prelude, pass `npm run typecheck` and every unit test, and ship INERT.
    `main/codex-identity-record-wiring.test.ts` pins it at source level, the same remedy
    `hook-verified-parity.test.ts` uses for the same class of hole.
  - **Every generated sh client walks the SAME endpoint failover** (`nt_candidates`/`nt_adopt`,
    `core/agents/hook-endpoint-failover-sh.ts`) — issue #445, the endpoint-level twin of #384: a
    session is pinned for life to the endpoint PATH it got at tmux creation, so an app
    quit/restart (or a retired project id) leaves it POSTing at a dead port while a live endpoint
    file sits right next to it. The managed hook script had the bounded candidate walk (locals
    before tunnels, `nt_fallback_max` 3, token re-read from the ADOPTED endpoint's dir); the two
    shims did not, so hook events healed themselves while every canvas-control verb died with
    "control endpoint unreachable" — in the field, a reviewer launch silently dropped. Now shared,
    one definition. Two server-side halves in `hook-server.ts`: a FAILED `listen()` un-wedges the
    singleton (it used to leave `this.server` set, making every retry a silent no-op at port 0)
    and `stop()` deletes only the endpoint contents this run published — a failed start cannot
    erase another owner's advertisement. A crash skips cleanup, which is why clients still walk
    the candidates.
    HTTP 421 means the bearer belongs to a different endpoint and is rejected BEFORE dispatch;
    it joins dead transport (curl 000/'') in the bounded discovery walk. A node-identity 403/400
    remains final and is never re-sent to another instance. The walk is skipped under
    `CODEX_SANDBOX_NETWORK_DISABLED` for transport failures (#367); an explicit 421 proves
    transport worked and still permits discovery. The final error distinguishes "no endpoint
    anywhere" from "an
    advertised endpoint that is not listening" (`STALE_ENDPOINT_HINT`). Desktop quit calls
    `hookServer.stop()` on the second before-quit pass, after the flush window.

  - **Hook endpoint ownership (#826):** startup first probes every transport in an existing
    endpoint advertisement and preserves a live or uncertain owner. The local Unix listener probes its socket before
    cleanup. Only `ECONNREFUSED` plus the same device/inode permits removal; a live listener,
    non-socket, symlink or uncertain probe disables hooks without replacing its endpoint.
    Both shells use `startForApp`: Desktop creates its window and then shows an actionable warning;
    Server Edition logs the same warning and continues boot. An authenticated owner must answer
    `/verify` with 204 for the advertised bearer AND reject a random bearer (403/421); unrelated
    HTTP responses are uncertain listeners, not authenticated nodeterm. Probes have a hard deadline.
    Endpoint writes are atomic and stop removes only the run's own advertised contents. SSH setup
    never removes a socket before binding: every forward gets a fresh random path, while discovery
    is stable per project + installation identity hash. Only a verified replacement is advertised;
    then this run cancels its previous forward. A legacy project endpoint is migrated only when its
    bearer matches the current run, the previous installation-qualified advertisement, or a stale
    conventional local advertisement retained at boot. Publication rechecks the snapshot digest,
    refuses symlinks, uses a migration lock and a private temp, and never places credentials in argv.
    Without ownership proof (including a first upgrade after the old local advertisement was deleted),
    it preserves the file and logs instructions to restart affected agent sessions; discovery still
    works but may incur the old dead-tunnel delay until then. No real-host upgrade is claimed by unit tests. A reused tunnel that loses bearer verification
    emits hook-only health updates: the desktop shows a warning and clears it after repair, without
    reconnecting terminals. These changes share the core listener in Desktop and Server Edition;
    the mobile wire protocol and node-identity rules are unchanged.

  Enforcement is dated (`NODE_IDENTITY_STRICT_AFTER`, 2026-10-13, read through `isStrictInstant` so a
  clock years ahead cannot enter strict mode early) with a `settings.hookIdentityStrict` escape hatch
  in Settings → Agents. **Trust on first proof latches a node the moment it authenticates, so it
  refuses TODAY, not on the cutoff** — which is why every token sweep must also call
  `hookServer.forgetProvenNode`. `/hook/*` never 403s a missing token: the phone, the cross-instance
  failover and every pre-token session legitimately have none.
- **Shared Claude/Gemini settings are user data (issue #851).** The local hook install/remove
  and Claude fullscreen writers share `core/agents/hooks/settings-file.ts`; SSH system/account
  hook installs and fullscreen writes share `remote-settings-file.ts`. Only ENOENT / the remote
  explicit missing-file status or a successfully read empty/whitespace file starts from `{}`.
  Malformed/non-object/read-error settings are preserved. Each transaction stages the complete output, takes a `.nodeterm-lock` directory,
  compares its original bytes before rename, and preserves the file mode. Remote snapshots and
  replacements travel on stdin, with a byte-count check against truncated transport; the shell
  needs no Python/Node/jq. Local profiles resolve symlinks and lock/update the shared target,
  rechecking resolution before publication. SSH does the same with plain readlink + cd -P
  (macOS-compatible, no GNU -f), bounding cycles and refusing dangling links/newline paths.
  Grok's owned file heals malformed JSON and hook shapes by rebuilding its managed config.
  A held or crash-left lock skips the update with a diagnostic naming the lock and instructing
  the user to stop writers before inspecting/removing a stale lock; it never gets stolen. External editors need not honor our lock: the final comparison detects edits
  during merge/staging, but cannot eliminate an external write between comparison and rename.
  No claim that the reporter's historical wipe was proven to take this path: the catch-to-empty
  writer and its data loss were reproduced in fixture homes.
- **Fullscreen TUI (Claude)** — through the SAME `settings.json` seam the hook installer uses,
  nodeterm ensures Claude's `"tui": "fullscreen"` so a session takes the alternate screen + mouse
  and behaves natively in tmux (else a drag falls into copy-mode). Two guardrails: **write-if-absent**
  (any existing `tui` value — e.g. a user's `/tui default` — is never touched;
  `core/agents/hooks/claude-tui.ts` `ensureFullscreenTui`) and **version-gated** to CLI ≥ 2.1.89
  (`supportsFullscreenTui` / `claudeCliCaps().fullscreenTui`; unknown ⇒ don't write). Runs
  everywhere the hook seam does: local `~/.claude` + managed account dirs at launch/add-account
  (`ensureClaudeFullscreenTui{,Into}`), and the remote host + account dirs on SSH connect
  (`RemoteHooks.ensureFullscreenTui{,InAccountDir}`, gated on the connection's cached remote probe).
  **Grok has no analogue** — it runs full-screen by default, so there is nothing to write.
- **Unread + notification** — on a busy→idle edge while the window is unfocused
  (`document.hasFocus()`), the node is marked unread (header dot, minimap stroke, project-tab
  dot). If notifications are enabled, `window.nodeTerminal.notify()` → main `app:notify`
  (shown only when `mainWin.isFocused()` is false); clicking it focuses the window and sends
  `app:focus-node` → `Canvas.focusNodeById` (selects + centers, switching projects via
  `pendingFocusRef` if needed). A one-time consent prompt gates notifications; toggle in
  Settings (`notifyOnClaudeDone`). Selecting, focusing, dwelling into, or opening a session card
  clears `unread` and ACKs the finish across phone/notch surfaces — existing read-on-view behavior.
  This NEVER changes the workflow bucket: read state is independent from agent state.
- **Status-grouped sessions** — three always-visible sections: **Waiting for your response** maps
  internal `done`, `waiting`, and `blocked` together (a completed turn, question, or approval all
  need the user); **Running** maps `working`; **Unknown** means no live hook state is available.
  There is no Done bucket: a normal `done` hook means the turn ended and the agent is waiting for
  another user prompt. Within each section rows sort newest-first by `lastEventAt`, the transition
  clock (same-state hook freshness is `stateAt`), and show its short relative age. Missing clocks
  stay last with no made-up timestamp. A click may clear the glow but cannot move the row.
- **Session name ⇄ node title** — **two lists, because the two directions are separate facts**:
  `TITLE_READ_CAPABLE` (`canReadTitle` — claude, **codex**, grok, **gemini**) is the READ leg,
  `RENAME_CAPABLE` (`canRename` — claude, grok) the WRITE leg, and **read ⊇ write** is an invariant
  pinned in `config.capabilities.test.ts`. Gemini and codex are the reason: they name their own
  sessions (codex via `readCodexSessionName`) but have **no rename command** (gemini's `/chat save
  <tag>` is a checkpoint, not a title), so one list for both legs would light the rename UI on a
  node where the write silently does nothing. The **write** is the same literal
  `/rename <name>` for claude and grok; the **read** legs are per-agent and none may ever
  search another's tree, so the routing lives in ONE place, `core/agent-session-name.ts`
  (`readAgentSessionName(sessionId, accountId?, agentId?, deps?)` — trailing/optional so every pre-grok
  caller is unchanged), serving the desktop IPC handler **and** both shells' session-name sweeps.
  Grok's read leg is `core/grok-session.ts` over `summary.json` in the session dir a hook told us
  about; gemini's is `pickGeminiTitle` (`core/gemini-session.ts`) over the transcript path its context
  tail already tracks — including the `$set` history a **resume** replays, which is exactly the case the
  read leg exists for. Routing is not cosmetic — claude's resolver *scans* `~/.claude/projects` on a
  cache miss, so an unrouted grok/gemini node paid that scan every 60 s for a guaranteed null.
  **The sweep's gate lives in core, not in the shells:** `startSessionNameSweep` defaults `supports` to
  `supportsTitleRead` (`core/session-name-sweep.ts`) and neither shell passes it — the duplicated copies
  drifted, and reverting both to `canRename` left the whole suite green while silently skipping every
  gemini node.
  - **session → title (read, claude):** the authoritative name lives in the transcript `.jsonl`, not the
    OSC terminal title (`/rename` does **not** update OSC — a known Claude gap — so reading the
    file is the only thing that works after a **resume**). `core/transcript-reader.ts`
    `readSessionName(sessionId)` resolves the session file **strictly by sessionId** (no cwd
    fallback — that would make every Claude node in one folder resolve to the same newest transcript
    and adopt each other's names) and `pickSessionName` returns the latest `custom-title`'s
    `customTitle` (the `/rename` name) else the latest `ai-title`'s `aiTitle` (auto name). Exposed
    over `pty.readSessionName`. `TerminalNode` polls it (~4 s) **only once this node's own sessionId
    is known** and **while the title still auto-tracks** (`data.titleAuto`, default true on agent
    nodes), and adopts it as the `title`. `term.onTitleChange` now feeds the `session` chip only.
    **A poll of an unchanged transcript reads no bytes**: the local read is gated on the resolved
    path's (size, mtime) (`titleCache`, bounded at 500, a failed tail read never cached), and the
    remote one (`main/remote-title-reader.ts`) on the remote context tail's `offsetFor` for the SAME
    path — that offset is the file size at the tail's last read, so a remote `/rename` lands within
    the tail's idle backoff (real gaps between idle reads ≈3/5/9/11 s) PLUS one title poll
    (4–15 s); an untracked session (offset unknown) always reads.
  - **title → session (write):** the moment the user renames the node by hand (header rename box /
    ✦ AI-name / sidebar / command palette → all funnel through `applyManualTitle` or
    `renameSession`), `titleAuto` flips to **false** (polling stops overwriting) and the chosen name
    is pushed into the live session as `/rename <name>` via `pty.sendText` (tmux `send-keys`, same
    one-way bridge as Branch's `/branch`; works whether or not the node is mounted).
  - The launch command is left bare (no `-n`) — Claude's own name is canonical until the user
    overrides it; `titleAuto` is persisted so an overridden name survives reload/resume.
- **Search** — the command palette (⌘K) matches the session name + tags + `nt-<id>` in the
  hint, and substring-searches each terminal's **visible buffer** (captured via `pty.capture`
  on palette open, cached ~3s); content matches show "found in output".
- **⌘M transcript view (`ChatPanel`) — resolution is three-legged, and each leg fails differently.**
  `chat.readTranscript(sessionId, cwd, accountId, nodeId)` returns `ChatTranscriptResult
  {messages, found}`, NOT a bare array: an empty thread and an unresolvable transcript are
  different facts, and rendering both as "No conversation yet." is what made every failure below
  look like an empty session. (1) **Remote (SSH) nodes** — `remoteTranscriptBySession` is fed
  ONLY by hook POSTs, and a tmux session outlives the app, so after a restart an idle remote node
  has no ref and the local resolvers search the WRONG MACHINE. `remoteTranscriptRefFor` (main)
  therefore asks the host itself: the pure `core/remote-transcript-locate.ts` builds one `sh` line
  (exact `<root>/<encoded cwd>/<id>.jsonl` per root, then a glob; account root before the system
  one; `*` outside the quotes; **exits 0 on a clean miss** — "no transcript" is an answer, not a
  failed ssh), it runs over the ControlMaster, and the reply is jailed by
  `isSafeRemoteTranscriptPath` before it is read. A ref WE located is tracked in
  `locatedTranscriptSessions` so a dead one can be dropped on an empty read (the panel's Retry
  would otherwise replay it forever) — a HOOK-fed ref is never dropped that way, since an empty
  read there is usually a transient master hiccup and forgetting it sends the next read local.
  It is generated shell, so `remote-transcript-locate.test.ts` runs it for real under `/bin/sh`
  against a fake host tree — keep it that way. (2) **The cwd fallback keeps `accountId`** in BOTH
  `resolveTranscript` and `contextEnsure`; without it a managed-account node fell back to the
  system root and could adopt an unrelated session's newest transcript. (3) **Relay tabs** stay
  local-only (a transcript read over the relay would read the GUEST's disk) and reject with
  `E_UNSUPPORTED`; ChatPanel catches it and says so instead of leaving the initial `[]` on screen
  as an empty conversation. Same `nodeId` rides `claude.readTranscript`, so the find-bar searches
  a remote node's transcript too.
  **Both channels live in `core/transcript-ipc.ts` (`registerTranscriptIpc`), so the Server
  Edition serves them too** — it used to have no handler at all, which is why ⌘M in the browser
  read as an empty conversation on EVERY session. The remote leg is an injected dep
  (`readRemote` — `null` = "not a remote session"): `src/main` supplies it, the server passes
  none, which is complete there because it runs ON the host whose transcripts it reads. The
  server registers it in `src/server/index.ts` right after `wireAgentStatus` (which now returns
  its `contextTail`, the hook-fed path authority). The browser's real reader is
  `buildTranscriptApi` in ws-bridge — deliberately NOT folded into `buildClaudeApi`, which the
  relay shares and must not adopt it.
  **Paged reads (2026-09).** `chat.readTranscript` takes a trailing optional `page`
  (`{before?, maxBytes?}`, `shared/chat-page.ts`). Absent = the legacy 5 MB-tail read, byte for byte
  (result is exactly `{messages, found}`). Present = ONE window of at most `maxBytes` (clamped
  64 KB…5 MB — it is untrusted IPC/WS input; an invalid `before` REJECTS rather than being coerced
  to "end of file") ending at byte `before`, and the result adds `olderCursor` (where the window's
  first complete line starts — the next page's `before`; `null` = reached the start), a per-message
  `key` (the line's ABSOLUTE byte offset — stable across prepends and appends), `id` on tool parts,
  and `unmatchedResults` (tool results whose `tool_use` sits in an OLDER window: the newer page is
  read first, so the renderer holds them until that page arrives). Parsing is the pure
  `parseChatWindow` over BYTES (a multi-byte char cut by the window edge only lands in the dropped
  partial line), and every window is read with **one byte of lookbehind** — the only way to know a
  line begins exactly on the edge; without it that line is dropped as "partial" and lost. A window
  with **no complete line** (one record bigger than the window — in practice a `type:user` line
  carrying a pasted screenshot or an image tool_result; 181 lines over 512 KB in 30 days on one
  host) is flagged `noCompleteLine` and **re-read at the same `before` with ×4 the bytes, up to the 5 MB cap**
  (`parseGrowingWindow` in `core/transcript-ipc.ts` — local AND SSH leg; a failed re-read is
  not-found, never the skip). Only a line **longer than 5 MB** is skipped (`olderCursor = window
  start`, never the window end, which would re-request the identical window forever) — before this,
  every line bigger than the page vanished, a regression against the legacy 5 MB read. The **SSH leg** is a ranged read
  (`transcriptPageCommand`, `core/remote-ssh/transcript-window.ts` — size + window in ONE round
  trip, dd status inside the base64 like the context-tail's window command) instead of pulling the
  5 MB tail on every open and every turn-end reload; its `{ok:false}` is terminal (never the local
  disk), and it is tested under a real `/bin/sh` (`transcript-page.realsh.test.ts`). **Grok does not
  page**: a paged request gets its whole capped read with `olderCursor: null` and no keys.
  Server Edition passes `page` through ws-bridge to the same core handler; relay still refuses.
  **ChatPanel consumes it progressively** (pure state in `renderer/lib/chatPaging.ts`): the first
  read is a 256 KB tail (`CHAT_TAIL_PAGE_BYTES`, with a "Loading conversation…" row), older 512 KB
  pages load when the user scrolls within 200 px of the top (or by themselves while the thread is
  shorter than the viewport — it cannot scroll), one at a time behind their own token, prepended
  with the scroll position ANCHORED on the scrollHeight delta (the loading row's own appearance
  included). A turn-end reload / ↻ re-reads only the tail and **merges by key**, keeping the older
  pages already loaded — unless no rendered message reaches into the new window (the turn wrote
  more than a whole window, so the bytes in between were never read): then it RESETS to the tail
  rather than stitch over a hole. Carried tool results are held until their tool's page arrives and
  dropped at the start of the file. `found:false` on an OLDER page is a failed page load (retry row,
  thread kept), not a missing transcript; a reload that fails to resolve never blanks a rendered
  thread — only a read with nothing on screen says "No transcript found". The remote leg's
  forget-a-located-ref rule lives in `main/remote-transcript-page.ts` (a hook-fed ref is never
  dropped on a failed read, and a hook event re-marks a located ref as hook-fed). Grok: one
  unkeyed read, no older pages, no "Beginning of conversation" marker (a capped read cannot know).
  **Loading surfaces (2026-09).** The lazy ChatPanel chunk suspends into `ChatPanelFallback` at
  ALL THREE mount sites (canvas node, kanban card modal, closed-transcript dialog — it replaced a
  `fallback={null}` that left the ⌘M face blank over the terminal): the panel's own shell plus
  `ChatLoadingStatus`, which ChatPanel's initial "Loading conversation…" row renders too, so the
  handover is identical DOM (a second row swapped rings and re-announced its `role=status`). Its
  spinner is the app's ONE spinner, `components/Spinner` / `.nt-spinner` — frozen, not hidden,
  under `prefers-reduced-motion`; never add a local one. A terminal node's label row ends in a
  quiet ⌘M hint (`lib/mdViewHint.ts`, id `md-hint`, hideable in Settings → Appearance) naming the
  EFFECTIVE chord and what it opens on that node; it sits in a zero-basis trailing slot that
  clips, so it can never add a line to the row (a height flip would refit xterm and SIGWINCH
  tmux). It is not on the kanban card modal: that header already carries the ⌘M toggle.
  **The composer sends only in `done` or an unknown state** (`canSendFromChat`,
  `renderer/lib/chatSendGate.ts`) — never in `waiting`/`blocked`, not just never in `working`:
  PermissionRequest and AskUserQuestion both normalize to `waiting`, the pane then holds a TUI
  select dialog this view does not show, and `sendText`'s Enter would ANSWER it ("Yes" is the
  default highlight). It also refuses any node whose CLI has left the pane — hibernated, paused,
  dropped, or **exited** (`/exit`/Ctrl+D: `state: undefined` + `sessionEnded`) — because a SHELL
  owns it and the message would run as a shell command. That test is `agentProcessInPane`
  (`terminal/live-work.ts`), the same single rule the memory levers use — never a second copy of
  the flag set — and it ranks above the state (`chatSendRefusal`). Everything is re-read from the
  store at send time, not only at render. Same trap as the in-place restart's `/exit`. The bar's ↻
  reloads on demand (beside the empty state's Retry), since a session whose hooks never report
  `working` never takes the turn-finish reload.
  **Plan and question bodies (2026-09).** A tool call is normally a collapsed chip (`name` + a
  ≤200-char `arg`), which left an `ExitPlanMode` plan — the full markdown the terminal shows as
  "Here is Claude's plan" — and an `AskUserQuestion` question + options unreadable in ⌘M, the one
  place meant for reading them. `core/chat-tool-body.ts` (pure) fills the tool part's optional
  `body` for exactly those two tools (`input.plan`; the questions rendered as markdown), capped at
  64K characters (never splitting an open code fence or a surrogate pair; model-authored labels are
  kept to one line with emphasis escaped), degrading to no body (the old chip) on any other shape;
  ChatPanel shows a part with a body as an expanded "Plan"/"Question" card through `MarkdownText` with its result under it, and
  the find-bar index (`linesFrom`) indexes the body in full like assistant text.
- **Subagent visualization** (agents in `SUBAGENT_CAPABLE`) — `subagent-start`/`subagent-end`
  normalized events (from Claude's `PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse` on tool `Agent`/`Task`, correlated
  by `tool_use_id`) drive a transient `state/agentNodes.ts` store. Claude launches subagents
  **async by default**: that PostToolUse is only a launch ack (`status:'async_launched'`), NOT the
  end — normalize keeps the card working, the transcript tail keeps streaming, and the real end is
  the `<task-notification>` queued into the parent transcript (sniffed by the context tails →
  synthetic `subagent-end` in `index.ts`; the notification's `UserPromptSubmit` is also not a
  `newTurn`, so it doesn't clear the fan-out). Canvas renders each subagent
  as an **ephemeral** `SubagentNode` (display-only card: type + task + working/done) connected by
  an **edge** to its parent agent node. These ephemeral nodes/edges live outside the React Flow
  `nodes` state (merged only at the `<ReactFlow>` prop), so they're never persisted
  (`flowToNodeStates`) nor in undo/dirty. **Two different clears, and the difference is
  load-bearing (issue #547):** the removal paths (node delete, project delete, the cross-project
  close, the orphan-session kill, `SessionEnd`) call `clearForParent`, which drops everything —
  a node that is gone has no work left to represent. A **new turn** calls
  `clearFinishedForParent`, which drops only `state === 'done'`. "The previous fan-out is stale by
  definition" is true of a finished card and false of a working one: Claude launches subagents
  **async**, so *"waiting for N background agents to finish"* is exactly the state in which the
  next prompt gets typed, and nothing rehydrates `byId` afterwards (`start()` fires only from a
  live `PreToolUse`; a subagent past that emits no second one) — the card was gone for the rest of
  the run while the agent kept working. The expensive half is not the missing card: Eco's
  hibernation guard derives `liveSubagents` from this same store, so the wipe let a parent with
  live background agents read as idle and get its CLI `/exit`ed. Keeping an unfinished card then
  **owes a decay** — `useAgentNodes.sweepStaleWorking`, on the same 60 s tick and the same
  `WORKING_STALE_MS` as `agentStatus`'s (imported, never re-chosen: `shared/agents/stale.ts` exists
  because three surfaces each invented their own timeout) — or a subagent whose end never arrives
  pins its card, and its parent, forever. It marks the card **done** rather than deleting it, so a
  late `finish()` is the no-op it already was and the next turn boundary takes it.
  **A third removal path is opt-in:** `settings.autoHideFinishedSubagentCards` (default OFF, and
  off reproduces the two paths above exactly) mirrors into the store as `autoHideFinished`, and
  with it on a card is dropped the moment its subagent REPORTS done, with no turn boundary. Only a
  DONE card is ever dropped, so #547's rule (a new turn keeps the cards of subagents still running)
  and Eco's `liveSubagents` are untouched. **The decay is deliberately NOT one of the paths it
  gates**: `sweepStaleWorking` fires precisely because the end never ARRIVED, which is the opposite
  of what the setting promises, and it is the one case where a visible card carries the most
  information — drop it and a fan-out whose subagents died silently leaves nothing on the canvas
  saying one was ever launched. It costs Eco nothing either way, since an absent card and a `done`
  card are the same answer to `liveSubagents`. Renderer only: Desktop and Server Edition identical,
  Mobile N/A.
  (Subagents share the parent's process — no PTY.) Each card shows
  duration/tokens/tool-uses and **expands** (click) to a **live transcript**:
  `core/subagent-tail.ts` resolves the subagent's own transcript file
  (`<…>/<sessionId>/subagents/agent-<id>.jsonl`, matched by `tool_use_id` via the sibling
  `.meta.json`), tails it read-only, formats each line (assistant text + tool calls + results),
  and streams chunks over `agent:subagent-activity` into the store.
  **Codex** (2026-08-24, `spawn_agent` collaboration — issue #401) joined via its **native
  `SubagentStart`/`SubagentStop` hooks**, measured on codex-cli 0.146.0, keyed by `agent_id` (NOT
  `tool_use_id` — nothing correlates the spawn tool call with the Start it launches; agent_id is
  stable across the child's life, parallel + nested spawns included, and nested children fire
  through the same subscription so every card connects flat to the owning terminal node). Facts a
  refactor must not lose: **(1)** every agent_id-tagged codex event carries the PARENT's
  `session_id` with the CHILD's rollout as `transcript_path` — both raw listeners skip the
  context-meter track for them (else the parent's meter re-points at the child) and `normalizeCodex`
  returns null for child tool events (else a child Bash event flips a finished parent back to
  RUNNING after an async spawn); pinned by `hook-verified-parity.test.ts`. **(2)** the spawn task
  text is **encrypted end-to-end** (`tool_input.message` and the NEW_TASK payload are Fernet blobs)
  — there is no `taskLabel`; the readable `Task name:` header reaches the card via the activity
  stream instead. **(3)** the live tail is `subagentTail.trackFile` (the path is handed to us —
  no meta-dir matching) with the **stateful, per-entry** `createCodexSubagentFormatter`
  (`core/codex-subagent-format.ts`): a spawn child is a FORK of the parent thread, so its rollout
  opens with a replay of the parent's context, suppressed until the
  `inter_agent_communication_metadata` / NEW_TASK gate — per entry, because two concurrent
  subagents sharing one closure would gate each other. **(4)** codex's `SubagentStop` IS the real
  end (no async-launch-ack trap, no task-notification sniffing), carrying
  `last_assistant_message` as the card's result. Remote (SSH) codex nodes get cards but no live
  activity yet (the child rollout is on the host; claude's `remote-subagent-tail` has no codex
  counterpart — follow-up).
  **Grok** (2026-09) joined via its own native `SubagentStart`/`SubagentStop`, measured on
  grok 1.0.13 by launching two `explore` children in parallel. Keyed by `subagentId` occupying
  the same `toolUseId` slot the store already uses (claude correlates by `tool_use_id`,
  codex by `agent_id`; grok has no tool call behind a subagent). Facts a refactor must not
  lose: **(1)** the start's `sessionId` is the PARENT's and the stop's is the CHILD's own
  (equal to `subagentId`) — keying on it files start and stop under different cards and the
  started one never closes. **(2)** the child's transcript is DERIVED from `subagentId` as
  `chat_history.jsonl` (`core/grok-subagent-format.ts`); the start's `transcriptPath` is the
  PARENT's, and even the stop names `updates.jsonl`, which parses to nothing. **(3)** a
  `session_end` bearing `subagentType` returns early in both raw listeners — without that a
  child finishing tears down the PARENT's session state. **(4)** `description` arrives only
  on the start. The four captured payloads live in
  `src/shared/agents/__fixtures__/grok/hook-payloads.json`, pinned by
  `normalize.grok.capture.test.ts`. Remote (SSH) grok nodes get cards from the hook but no
  live tail yet (the child dir is on the host; same gap as codex).
- **/loop, /schedule & /cron node** (agents in `RECURRING_CAPABLE`) — detected from the **tools**
  the agent invokes (robust; users often phrase it in natural language so the prompt rarely starts
  with the slash): `PreToolUse` for `Skill` (skill ∈ loop/schedule/cron), `CronCreate` (→ cron,
  label = cron expr · prompt), or `ScheduleWakeup` (→ loop) — plus a `UserPromptSubmit`
  `/loop|/schedule|/cron` prompt-prefix fallback, all surfaced as `recurring` normalized events.
  Sets `agentStatus.loop` ({count, prompt, items, kind}); for in-session `loop` each turn-done
  bumps the count + appends `lastMessage` (schedule/cron run in the background, so they aren't
  counted). Lifetime by kind: `loop` dies with its session; `cron`/`schedule` **outlive turns,
  sessions and app restarts** (`loop` is persisted in the agentStatus localStorage) and are
  cleared by a `CronDelete` `recurring`-end event or the card's own × (dismisses the card only).
  `clearForParent` (new turn) leaves the loop card's dragged position alone. Renders an ephemeral
  **LoopNode** labelled by kind, connected by an edge to the parent, plus a small header badge.
- **Branch conversation** — node action (`IconBranch`, Claude-only via `BRANCH_CAPABLE`): sends `/branch` into the
  existing terminal via `pty.sendText` (tmux `send-keys`) and opens a new Claude node that
  resumes the parked original with `claude --settings … -r <ORIGINAL_ID>`. The original id is
  the session id already known from hooks; `lib/claudeBranch.ts` is the fallback that parses
  `pty.capture` output when the id isn't known. The source node stays on the new branch.
- **Canvas control (manage-nodeterm-canvas)** — agents in `CANVAS_CONTROL_CAPABLE`
  (claude/codex/gemini/copilot/opencode/grok) can create/organize/control canvas nodes from inside their
  session: a POSIX **sh+curl** shim (`nodeterm.sh`, `CONTROL_SHIM_SCRIPT` in
  `main/canvas-control-core.ts` — the Electron-as-Node CLI is retired) POSTs
  **form-urlencoded** (`nodeId` + `arg.<flag>` fields; `curl --data-urlencode` is the only
  escaping sh can be trusted with — `parseControlBody` reads both this and the JSON dialect) to
  the hook server's `/control/<verb>` routes; `Accept: text/plain` makes the server render the
  reply (sh has no JSON parser). Env-gated on `NODETERM_CANVAS_CONTROL` (set by
  `buildPtyEnv`/`remoteHookEnvArgs` per `canControlCanvas`). Discovery: claude gets a
  `skills/manage-nodeterm-canvas/SKILL.md` (system `~/.claude` + each managed account dir);
  codex/gemini/opencode plus Copilot's `copilot-instructions.md` get a marker block
  (`<!-- nodeterm:manage-canvas:start/end -->`); **grok needs
  no installer at all** — it scans `~/.claude/skills` by default for Claude compat, so membership alone
  (which sets `NODETERM_CANVAS_CONTROL`) is the whole wiring. That premise rests on grok's shipped
  docs and is **unverified** (`grok inspect --json` never run); if it does not hold, grok takes the
  marker-block route instead — see docs/grok-agent.md.
  **Server creator ownership (2026-08 incident hardening):** enabled Server control accepts only
  verified node identity. `HeadlessNodeFactory` records which source node opened each new node in a
  process-local ledger; link/group/rename/color/sticky-update, message delivery, and close validate
  the whole target set as current-run creations before writing or killing anything. Queued messages
  revalidate creator ownership before flush. The ledger is intentionally empty after restart —
  project JSON, titles, hook history and tmux names are not creator proof — so
  boot neither attaches/creates backends nor sends persisted queued commands. A live backend with a
  durable arm remains untouched until an explicit owner action or browser view. `open-terminal` and
  `open-agent` are verified-only at the Server handler boundary. A plain terminal keeps generic
  node hook wiring but receives neither `NODETERM_AGENT_ID` nor `NODETERM_CANVAS_CONTROL`; missing
  identity never defaults to Claude.
  **SSH projects** (docs/ssh-agent-skills.md): the SAME shim + skill + blocks are installed on
  the remote host at connect (`RemoteHooks.installCanvasControl` + per-account
  `installCanvasSkillIntoAccountDir`), gated on the VERIFIED reverse hook tunnel — the shim
  carries no machine-specific paths and POSTs through the tunnel's unix socket, so remote agents
  control the desktop's canvas. The shim is generated source no compiler checks:
  `canvas-control-shim.test.ts` runs it for real (/bin/sh against a real hook server, port AND
  unix-socket transports) — keep it that way.
  **NO VERB MAY ACTIVATE A PROJECT TAB** (`src/shared/control-off-screen.ts`). Routing is by
  SOURCE — the request names the agent's own node, and the dispatch must find the canvas that owns
  it — so for years "that canvas is not on screen" was answered by `travelToProject`. The user was
  typing in project B; a background agent in project A issued a `close`; the tab switched and A's
  saved viewport was applied. Their focus, camera and typing context were taken by a call they did
  not make. Two carve-outs (the cold open for `open-*`, then the display verbs) were each written
  as if it were the last, because nothing walked the whole table — twenty-one verbs still
  travelled. Every verb now has a decided disposition and NONE of them is travel:
  `STORE_ANSWERED_VERBS` (no canvas at either end), `COLD_OPENABLE_VERBS` (a session node, armed
  and inert until shown), `OFF_CANVAS_VERBS` (a display node, complete when written),
  `STORED_NODE_VERBS` (`write`/`close`/`rename`/`color`/`link`/`board`/`assign` — each reaches a
  pane, a store writer or the board file), and `OFF_SCREEN_REFUSALS` (the eleven that genuinely
  need live React Flow, each with its own reason in the refusal the agent reads). A refusal an
  agent can act on is strictly better than hijacking someone's screen. Load-bearing details:
  (1) **`ctlNodes()` is the one name for "the node array this call acts on"** — on screen it is
  `nodesRef.current` verbatim, off canvas it is the owning project's serialized nodes hydrated by
  `nodeStatesToFlow`. A verb body that resolves `--node` against the live array while answering
  for another project does not throw and does not travel; it silently renames, closes or reports
  on whatever the human happens to be looking at. `control-stored-node.source.test.ts` pins that
  no stored-node case mentions `nodesRef.current`. (2) **`board`/`assign` read `ctlProject`, not
  `activeProjectId`** — a second bug that was hiding behind the first, invisible while the travel
  made the two projects the same. (3) **`closeStoredNodes` is the ONE cross-project teardown**,
  shared with the sessions sidebar's `closeSession`; it is `deleteNodes` minus the closed-session
  ledger and ⇧⌘T history, which `deleteNodes` files against the ACTIVE project. `close` still ends
  the session off canvas because `transport.destroy` resolves a REMOTE node's host from the
  persisted index with no live client (`core/remote-end.ts`). (4) **There is no
  `travelToProjectRef` and there must not be one again**; `travelToProject` survives only for the
  facepile, the user's own navigation. (5) **The regression guard is
  `test/acceptance/control-verb-disposition.test.ts`**, cross-layer on purpose: it walks MAIN's
  `VERBS_FOR_TEST` against the RENDERER's disposition, which is the only way "every verb" is a
  checked claim rather than a list kept by hand. That is what nobody had, and why two carve-outs
  could ship without anyone noticing the other twenty verbs.
  **Keep the agent-facing text in sync with behaviour, in the SAME PR.** The verb help agents
  actually read is generated by `buildCanvasSkillBody` (the SKILL.md, rewritten into every config
  dir by `installCanvasSkillInto` on launch) and `buildCanvasControlInstructions` (the
  codex/gemini/copilot/opencode marker block) — both in `canvas-control-core.ts`. When you add or
  rename a verb, change a flag, or change what an outcome MEANS (e.g. PR 7 turned a busy target's
  `targetBusy` refusal into a deliver-on-idle queue), update those two functions in the same change,
  or the docs describe a product that no longer exists and an orchestrating agent acts on the stale
  contract. Derive from the code, never re-type: the retry guidance renders from `RETRYABLE`
  (`messagingGuidanceLines`) so a new outcome kind lands in the text the day it is added, and the
  off-screen paragraph renders from the verb table itself (`offScreenGuidanceLines`, which is why
  that table lives in `src/shared` — core cannot import the renderer) — prefer that shape over
  prose you have to remember to edit. `canvas-control-core.test.ts` walks both
  generated bodies and must red on the stale claim (it pins the queue wording and the RETRYABLE
  split); a doc line with no such test is a plan, not a fact — see the drift that shipped as #269.
  **Flag syntax**: `--flag value`, `--flag=value`, or a valueless flag anywhere on the line. The
  shim used to consume the next token after any `--flag` *unconditionally*, so `--read --node b1`
  became `arg.read=--node` with `b1` silently dropped and the server answering about the wrong
  flag; it now peeks. The trade: a value that itself starts with `--` must use the `=` form
  (`--cmd=--version`), which was previously unexpressible in either direction. Two parsers are in
  play and both are tested — the sh loop (`control-shim-parse.test.ts`, real `sh` + a fake `curl`
  that records argv) and `parseControlBody` reading what it built (`canvas-control-shim.test.ts`).
  **A new verb must not DEPEND on the fix**: the shim is rewritten locally every app boot but onto
  an SSH host only inside `RemoteHooks.setup()` (on connect), so an already-connected project keeps
  the old loop with no signal on the wire. Give every flag a value and both loops agree.
  **WHICH CANVAS ANSWERS, and why an open never moves the camera** (`renderer/lib/controlRouting.ts`
  + `renderer/lib/coldOpen.ts`). React Flow holds only the ACTIVE project's nodes, but every other
  open project's tmux sessions keep running, so a control call routinely arrives from a node the
  live canvas has never heard of. `routeControlSource` resolves the OWNING project
  (`active | switch | reopen | blocked | unknown`) — before that, every agent outside the project
  the app happened to come up on was rejected as *"source node is not a control-capable agent"*,
  which is a capability sentence for a routing failure. **That fix must not regress.** What it
  originally did with the answer was TRAVEL there (`travelToProjectRef`), and that was a screen
  hijack: the user looks at project B, an agent in project A runs `open-claude`, the tab switches
  and A's saved viewport is applied, so the camera appears to jump and zoom on a background agent's
  say-so. THREE membership lists now decide, and their differences are the whole design:
  - `STORE_ANSWERED_VERBS` (`needsLiveCanvas` false) = **no canvas is needed at either end** —
    `list` reads names, `send`/`reply` deliver into a tmux PANE, `sticky` rewrites a note,
    `open-project` acts on the projects store.
  - `COLD_OPENABLE_VERBS` (`canColdOpen` — `open-terminal`/`open-claude`/`open-agent`) = **a canvas
    IS needed, but the serialized one will do.** `needsLiveCanvas` stays TRUE for them; they take
    the `--project` cold-open path (issue #338 §2.2) applied to their own project: the composed
    launch MOVES into `pendingLaunch` (`armForColdOpen` — `initialCommand` is never serialized), the
    node is upserted through `applyNodeMutation`, edges go through `appendCanvasLinks` (the edge
    counterpart, so the opener's rope and the fan-in bridge are not lost), `writeDisk` persists, and
    the reply is the ONE shared `coldOpenMessage` sentence with `queued: true`.
  - `OFF_CANVAS_VERBS` (`answersOffCanvas` — `show-image`/`show-video`/`show-web`/`open-browser`)
    = **a canvas is needed, the serialized one will do, and there is nothing to defer.** The node
    these make has no session behind it: a page, a video, an image, a browser node is inert
    wherever it sits, so writing it into the owning project's serialized nodes IS the whole effect
    and it is complete when `writeDisk` returns. That is why it is a third set and not four more
    entries in the second one — a cold open reports `queued: true`, and a caller told its
    screenshot is queued waits for something that already happened. It gets
    `offCanvasReplyClause` and `offCanvas: true` instead. **This was the half the cold-open fix
    left open, and it is the half an agent meets most often**: a skill that renders its report as
    HTML reaches for `show-web` every time it finishes, and every one of those calls used to yank
    the user out of the project they were typing in. The verb bodies are untouched; three things
    they read from the canvas are staged — the colour index (`nodeCount`), the placement source
    (the stored node, hydrated through `nodeStatesToFlow` so its shape cannot drift from a live
    one's) and the append, where `applyNodeMutation` + `appendCanvasLinks` + `writeDisk` replace
    `setNodes` + `connect` + `markDirty`. The opener's edge is a **rope** and only a rope: a
    display node has nothing to read, so a bridge there would grant a context link the live path
    never draws. **`ctlProject` resolves from the SOURCE's project**, not the active one — off
    canvas it decides the ssh flag, the browser session key and the media allowlist route; on
    every other path the travel has already made the two the same project. None of the four takes
    `--group`, which is why this set owes no worktree question; a verb joining it that does would,
    because `cwdForNewNodeIn` subtracts `staleGroupIds`, which is epoch-scoped to the ACTIVE
    project.
  Everything else keeps travelling **on purpose**: `write`/`close`/`group`/`move`/`arrange`/
  `align`/`verify`/`spawn-team`/`open-worktree` read live canvas state the serialized copy does not
  carry (measured node sizes, worktree staleness, the React Flow edge arrays). **`browser` is the
  pair worth stating beside `open-browser`**: it NAVIGATES a mounted `<webview>` guest, which
  exists only while its project is on screen, so it travels; `open-browser` merely places the node
  and its guest is created when that project is next shown, exactly as a cold-opened terminal's PTY
  is. Route `active` is byte-identical to before.
  **The human is told, once, in the other voice.** The reply goes to the agent; without a strip the
  person sees nothing at all, and the whole point of not travelling is that the choice to go and
  look stays theirs — a choice they can only make if they are told there is something to look at.
  `offCanvasNoticeText` names the project and the button is `travelToNode` (which reopens a closed
  project first and resolves off the SERIALIZED nodes the write has already made). It is **sticky**:
  every other info strip reports something the user just did and is watching, this one reports work
  that landed while they were busy elsewhere, and once it fades nothing anywhere says it happened. Route **`reopen` (a CLOSED project) cold-writes
  too and does NOT reopen the tab** — closing is the user's explicit "park this, keep it running", so
  restoring the tab *and* activating it is the loudest form of the hijack; the reply names the closure
  so a caller does not report a session as started. On the cold path `--group`/`--after` ARE resolved
  (unlike with `--project`, where the ids would live in another project) against the serialized
  nodes, defaults come from the OWNING project (`projectPermissionMode(owner, …)`, its account,
  its `ssh`), and `--after`'s dep ropes are left to `missingDepRopes` at that project's next load.
  **The destructive confirm, and who may waive it** (`@shared/control-confirm`, 2026-09). The
  dialog `write` / `close` / `open-project` raise is the ONLY place a human stands between a
  canvas-control agent and the workspace — per-node identity is not enforced until
  `NODE_IDENTITY_STRICT_AFTER`, so a `legacy` caller still reaches the dispatch — and it used to
  ask EVERY time with no way to say "yes, all of them". Closing 14 finished stations was 14
  dialogs, and the 15th request was refused with `a confirmation is already pending`. Three things
  changed, and the last one was the actual bug:
  - **`close --node a,b,c` is ONE dialog** (`lib/closeTargets.ts`, pure). The grammar is not new —
    the Server Edition's headless `close` has read a comma list since it shipped, including its
    "validate the whole list before killing anything" rule; the DESKTOP dispatch read the flag as
    one id, so a comma list called `deleteNodes(['a,b,c'])` (a no-op) and answered `closed a,b,c`.
    A destructive verb reporting success for work it did not do is worse than either doing or
    refusing it. The single-id form is bit-identical, **deliberately including its lack of an
    existence check**; the bulk form refuses the WHOLE list on an unknown id and names it, because
    with 14 ids the user cannot audit the list themselves. Capped at `CLOSE_BULK_MAX` (50) and the
    dialog spells out at most 12 names then counts the rest — a name the user cannot see is not
    consent.
  - **"Don't ask again" is bounded by SCOPE, not by permanence** (2026-09, revised). The checkbox
    offers two reaches and defaults to the narrower: **"while nodeterm is running"** — the
    transient `state/controlConfirm.ts`, memory only (not `settings.json`, not `localStorage`), per
    VERB, so quitting restores the gate — or **"always in <project name>"**, persisted in
    `settings.controlConfirmWaivers.projects` as `{ [projectId]: verbs }`. The machine-WIDE
    `always` is still reachable only from Settings → Agents, where the option says "permanently":
    a dialog that appeared under the user's hands must not switch a destructive gate off
    *everywhere* on one stray click. The per-project scope is what makes the offer honest — an
    app-run waiver is not what a user who ticks "don't ask again" means, and with only that and a
    machine-wide switch the real choices were "be asked forever" or "turn it off everywhere".
    Load-bearing details: (1) the waiver is keyed on the project the call **acts on**
    (`ctlProject`), not the active one — canvas control answers a background agent in its own
    project without moving the user's tab (@shared/control-off-screen), so reading the project on
    screen would grant, or honour, a waiver in the wrong repo; the same argument applies to the
    permission MODE the bypass lock weighs, which is why `controlConfirmDecision` takes a project
    id and resolves both from it. (2) It is **machine-local** — never `.nodeterm/project.json`,
    which is git-shared; the whole trap `bypassMode` needs two locks for. (3) It is **pruned** on
    every write (`pruneControlConfirmWaivers`, the rule `pruneCollapsedItems` states for
    `sidebarCollapsedItems`) against EVERY project including CLOSED ones — a closed project is
    parked, not gone — because settings.json is forever and a stale entry is a live security
    waiver keyed to an id nothing can name. The id being granted survives that prune because the
    merge happens after it, not by an exemption inside it; a safeguard no test can turn red is a
    comment, not a mechanism. (4) Precedence is narrowest-first among the persisted grants
    (session → project → always → bypass), so the notice names the waiver the user most likely
    wants back. (5) A waiver granted by a CANCEL must not exist at all (the grant hangs off
    `onConfirm`, pinned by `control-destructive.test.ts` and
    `control-confirm-scope.source.test.ts`), and a per-project grant that cannot be made (no
    project owns the call) falls back to the app-run waiver rather than silently to nothing.
    Waiving is not silence: every waived application raises the info strip through `waivedNotice`,
    which names the waiver that let it through — and, for the project scope, the PROJECT, since
    "this project" would point at whatever the user happens to be looking at — and every
    per-project waiver is listed with a Revoke in Settings → Agents.
  - **`bypassPermissions` needs TWO locks, and this is the trap to understand before touching it.**
    The permission mode is persisted to `.nodeterm/project.json`, which is **git-shared** — so
    keying the waiver on the mode alone would let a repository the user CLONED silently disable
    their destructive-action gate. It therefore requires a machine-local opt-in
    (`controlConfirmWaivers.bypassMode`, default off) **and** a mode that came from the user's own
    GLOBAL setting: `resolvePermissionModeWithSource` answers `project | global | default`, and
    only `global` can waive. `default` is its own answer rather than folded into `global` because
    nobody chose it, and reading an unset setting as a deliberate choice is reading consent into
    silence. The claude version gate is deliberately NOT applied here (it exists to degrade `auto`
    for an old CLI; a security decision must not hang on a `claude --version` probe).
  - **`open-project` can never be waived**, by table (`CONFIRM_WAIVABLE_VERBS`) rather than by a
    line somebody forgot at one of three call sites. It widens the app's blast radius (a new
    directory registered as a project, plus a grant the caller feeds to `--project`) instead of
    acting inside it, and it cannot produce the dialog storm the waiver exists to end —
    `recordAttachConsent` already dedupes it per (caller, project).
  **An agent-requested dialog knows its own request's lifetime** (`ConfirmState.expiresAt` /
  `onExpire`, `CONTROL_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` now shared with main). Main abandons a control request
  after 120 s and tells the renderer NOTHING, so the dialog stayed on screen asking about work
  nobody was waiting for — and, worse, kept `confirmBusy()` true, which refused every later
  `write`/`close` with `a confirmation is already pending — try again` for the rest of the app run.
  **That is the "the same dialog keeps coming back" report**, and it is a single-canvas loop: the
  reply says retryable, the agent retries, every retry is refused by the orphan, and the moment the
  user finally answers it a queued retry raises a fresh dialog for the same node. The deadline is
  measured from the RENDERER's receipt, so it always fires a hair AFTER main gave up, never before
  (the other direction would abandon a dialog whose answer main would still accept); it replies
  `expired` rather than `denied by user` (nobody denied anything, and a reply main has already
  timed out is simply dropped); and the notice is a fading info strip, because raising an alert
  would keep `confirmBusy()` true — i.e. reproduce the bug with better wording.
  **`close-worktree --mode remove`'s dialog expires too** (2026-09-11), through the SAME
  `renderer/lib/useExpiringDialog.ts` the confirm uses — the rule was extracted rather than copied,
  because a second effect beside the first is how one gains a fix the other silently lacks. Three
  differences to keep in mind, all deliberate: it carries **no `onExpire`** (the verb replies
  "removal confirmation shown to the user — they decide" the instant the dialog opens, so nobody is
  waiting on an answer and an `onExpire` would be a reply to a call that finished minutes ago); its
  clear must also release **`removePendingRef`**, the guard covering the async `git.status` gap
  before `removeTarget` exists, which `confirmBusy()` reads directly — dropping the state while
  leaving that ref latched closes the dialog and keeps refusing every later destructive verb, i.e.
  the bug minus the only thing on screen that explained it; and the deadline is set **only when
  `requestedBy` is present**, because a removal the USER opened from the group menu must never
  vanish under them. It reuses `confirmExpiresAt` rather than inventing a second timeout: the fact
  is the same class ("an agent asked and the human is not at the machine"), and this is the most
  dangerous dialog to leave lying around — the one carrying a pre-ticked delete-from-disk choice on
  a worktree the human never asked about.
  **MEASURED, and the answer is no: two canvases cannot raise two dialogs for one request.** The
  suspicion was worth checking because the same project can be open on a desktop and in a Server
  Edition browser at once. Desktop main forwards each request to `getMainWindow()` — one
  BrowserWindow, so at most one dialog exists per request; the Server Edition raises none at all
  (its control is HEADLESS — `HeadlessNodeFactory.close` is gated by verified identity plus
  process-local creator ownership, and the browser bridge's `onAgentControl` is `noopUnsub`); and
  the shim's endpoint failover cannot duplicate a request either, because the control POST carries
  **no `--max-time`**, so a POST waiting on a human eventually gets an HTTP answer and
  `nt_reached()` is true — failover fires only on a dead transport (`000`/empty). If a future change
  gives that curl a timeout, this paragraph stops being true: a confirm-gated verb would then fail
  over mid-wait and a second instance WOULD open a second dialog for the same logical request.
  **Grouping verbs** (`group` / `ungroup` / `move` / `arrange` / `align`): `group` wraps **sibling**
  objects — nodes or frames — into a new frame in their shared container (a mixed-container set, or
  an ancestor plus its descendant, is refused with that reason); `ungroup --group <id>` dissolves a
  frame, promoting its direct children into the frame's own parent (nodes kept); `move
  --nodes <id,id> [--group <id>]` reparents nodes OR whole frame subtrees INTO a frame (or
  `top`/`none`/omit → out to top level) via `reparentNode` — the ONE way to move a node between
  frames, which `group` won't do; a cycle (a frame into itself or its own descendant) is refused.
  `arrange`/`align` now run in ONE coordinate space: all top-level, OR all children of one frame
  (`commonParentId` decides; a mixed set is refused, not silently subset-arranged — the old
  behavior). When the ids are a frame's children, the frame is shrunk to hug the tidied layout
  (`fitGroupToChildren`) — the fix for "grouping keeps scattered positions so the frame is too
  wide". `move` also re-fits the source + destination frames. All pure + tested in
  `state/workspace.test.ts` + `workspace.layout.test.ts`.
  **Fan-in (`link`, 2026-07):** a spawned fan-out was previously write-only — nodes an agent
  opened were joined to it by a **rope** (`project.ropes`, explicitly *"Display-only — never
  context links"*), so an orchestrator could not read back what its own team produced and the
  skill told it to have the USER relay results. Now `open-claude`/`open-agent`/`spawn-team` also
  draw a real **context bridge** (`project.bridges`) to each agent session they open, and the
  `link --to <id,id> [--from <id>]` verb links nodes the agent did not open (or two other nodes).
  The rope stays — the two edges mean different things (lineage vs readable context) and a
  non-context-capable target still gets only the rope. Deliberately **silent**: the manual
  `onConnect` path pushes a discovery note into both endpoints, but doing that per team member
  would inject a prompt into every session an agent just spawned — the exact intrusion that push
  was reverted for. Links are pull-based, so nothing is lost. The refusal matrix is the pure
  `planBridges` (`renderer/lib/noteLink.ts`, unit-tested); Canvas only wraps it in setState.
  A missing endpoint is only absent from the calling project: report that scope and the
  unsupported cross-project boundary, without probing other projects or exposing their metadata.
  Callers that create and link nodes **in the same tick** must pass their own `lookup` — `setNodes`
  is async, so resolving fresh nodes off `nodesRef` would skip every one as "no such node".
  **Dependency edges (`--after`, 2026-07):** `open-terminal`/`open-claude`/`open-agent` accept
  `--after <id,id>`, which opens the node **armed** — `data.pendingLaunch` ({after, command},
  `PendingLaunch` in shared/types) holds the launch the factory built, and Canvas fires it once
  every dep reports `done`. This is what makes the canvas a DAG instead of a fan-out. Load-bearing
  details: (1) **an unknown agent state is NOT "satisfied"** — right after a fan-out no upstream has
  emitted a hook event yet, and reading "no news" as "finished" would fire every dependent
  instantly; a **deleted** dep IS satisfied (it can never report); and a dep that is `done` with a
  live **`lastTurnError`** is NOT (issue #521, below). (2) Only `hasHooks` agents may be
  waited on — a plain terminal never reports done, so `resolveAfter` **refuses** it rather than
  letting `launchesToFire` (which cannot tell "never will" from "not yet") hang the node forever.
  (3) **Control opens always retain the command in `pendingLaunch` until delivery lands**
  (#827/#811). Even a visible node with no deps has not mounted its PTY when the open reply is
  sent. `queueControlLaunch` moves the command out of `initialCommand`; the PTY-ready gate below
  makes this safe. The open reply says `queued`, and project serialization retains the brief.
  (4) Desktop automatic and manual launch delivery share `terminal/launch-command.ts`, which
  uses `deliverCommand`: echo verification, bounded Ctrl-U repair, platform kill-line and overlong
  line refusal. The PTY-lifetime writer coalesces concurrent requests and remembers submission
  across parked views. Relay queued/restored delivery, including Run now, is refused until a scoped durable
  claim API exists: a relay workspace load can be project-scoped, while save replaces the host
  index. Never use that load/save pair for a launch. A new relay UI initialCommand may instead
  use the verified writer once on a fresh PTY without creating pendingLaunch or writing workspace
  data. Its transient claim is consumed before settle and survives view remounts; relay snapshots
  omit that initial command rather than converting it to durable intent. A parked-project deferral before any input
  retains never-attempted intent and can proceed on activation without a retry timer.
  New intent has `attempted:false`; the writer awaits a workspace save of
  `attempted:true, manualOnly:true` before input, then rechecks the shell after that save. That
  save is **`localOnly`** (`WorkspaceStore.save`): durable in this machine's index, with no SSH
  read/reconcile/mirror — a changed entry is marked `unmirrored` and the next ordinary save pushes
  it. Awaiting the mirror put two SSH round trips in front of every new agent on an SSH project.
  A node's own first-open delivery (live `initialCommand`, no deps, no failure record) shows NO
  QUEUED chip: its `pendingLaunch` is only the write-ahead record, and it carries `manualOnly`
  from the claim until Enter lands, which painted "⚠ QUEUED" on every freshly opened agent. A warm
  attach may automatically deliver never-attempted intent, preserving long-running `--after`
  graphs through project switches/park expiry. Attempted/legacy-unknown intent stays manual: its
  clearing autosave may have been lost after Enter. Explicit Run now rechecks the foreground shell and
  clears any incomplete line; a refused/throwing/cancelled launch stays held, `manualOnly`.
  (5) UI `initialCommand` stays until submission; serialization converts unsubmitted UI intent
  into a never-attempted `pendingLaunch`, including a project switch during shell settle. A live
  initialCommand alias on remount cannot reset an attempted marker. Server saves
  `attempted:true, manualOnly:true` BEFORE sending and only clears the command after acknowledgment. Failed
  independent/dependent launches are never retried by unrelated hooks. Boot remains inert.
  Server deferred delivery is deliberately one-shot: a transient probe/send failure needs Run now.
  Desktop keeps the attached echo-verification transport even for offscreen held nodes; a large
  long-waiting fan-out therefore keeps those xterm instances in memory until delivery/recovery.
  (6) Canvas subscribes to `armedDepSig`, NOT `useAgentStatus(s => s.byId)` —
  the same discipline as `loopSig`; the full map re-renders the canvas on every hook event.
  Pure logic + refusal matrix in `renderer/lib/pendingLaunch.ts` (unit-tested);
  the dep→node edge is a **rope** (`ctrl-<dep>-<node>`, persisted in `project.ropes` like the
  opener's) whose LOOK is derived: dashed + ⏳ while the node's `pendingLaunch.after` still lists the
  dep, solid once it has launched (`lib/edgeModel.ts` `ropeVisual`, over the ONE `ropeInfoOf` lookup
  the render and BOTH delete paths ask — two builders would be two answers, and the label the user
  reads would stop describing what the delete does). The fan-in bridge `--after` also writes hides
  under that rope (`hiddenLinkIds`), so ONE edge per pair holds on the canvas. Deleting a WAITING
  rope drops that dep from `after` (`dropAfterDep`) and takes **nothing else** — the covered bridge
  survives, because "stop waiting for it" is not "stop being able to read its work"; an emptied
  list fires. Only the `open-*`/`verify` verbs write the rope, so `missingDepRopes` heals an armed
  node that has none at **project load**: `pendingLaunch` is persisted and the rope is not, so a node
  armed by any other path — or by a build older than this one — would otherwise hold a launch with
  no arrow saying what for. All edges route through the single `floating` edge type
  (`canvas/FloatingEdge.tsx`, a bezier between the MIDPOINTS of the two nodes' facing sides — one
  anchor per side, so a hub's arrows converge instead of fanning along its border; context and note
  links are restricted to the left/right sides, where the bridge handles sit; an unmeasured node
  draws nothing rather than a path to the origin) — no family sets a handle side;
  and a node whose eye is closed (`hideFanout`) hides every edge touching it as well as its cards
  (2026-09-02 edge model, spec in docs/superpowers/specs).
  **(7) Delivery waits for the node's PTY, and never fails silently** (issue #569 item 1, 2026-09).
  A satisfied dependency says nothing about whether there is a terminal to type into, and the
  original loop conflated the two: a flat 5 × 400 ms budget started when the CANVAS held the node
  and was spent on loading the canvas, mounting it and spawning tmux — so on a cold project switch
  the launch was abandoned before its session existed, in a `console.warn`, and the node read
  QUEUED forever with only the manual ▶ left. `TerminalNode` therefore publishes a **session-ready**
  signal (`isSessionReady` / `subscribeSessionReady`, module-level like `offscreenNodes`): true for
  an ADOPTED park (already typeable, and its create continuation ran on a previous mount) and, for
  a fresh spawn, at the SAME `whenShellSettled` moment `writeWhenShellReady` delivers an
  `initialCommand` — both write a CLI command line, and a line delivered across zsh's rc-file tty
  flush comes out mangled. A **park keeps the writer and transport**; a real teardown removes
  the writer. The loop WAITS instead of burning attempts before readiness. Once attempted,
  only the verified writer's bounded echo repair runs; further recovery is explicit.
  Because a wait with no end is the failure mode this replaces, both give-up states are **visible**
  in the transient `state/launchDelivery.ts` and rendered by the QUEUED badge's amber ⚠ + tooltip
  (`launchTooltip`, pure): `stalled` = gate open, no terminal yet, **still held** (raised by a
  `LAUNCH_STALL_MS` timer with a fire-time re-ask; the launch still fires whenever the session
  finally comes up) and `failed` = submission is unconfirmed, so automatic retry is stopped.
  A persisted `manualOnly` record carries that warning after reload too. Neither is ever inferred from silence, and
  the tooltip names no cause it did not measure (the node's own overlay owns the diagnosis).
  The open verbs' replies carry the same fact for callers OUTSIDE the app: `result.queued` +
  `result.queuedIds` on `open-terminal`/`open-claude`/`open-agent`, always true for the
  `--project` cold-open branch — an orchestrator was previously told "opened" either way and
  routed work to a session that did not exist. Agent-facing copy is generated in
  `canvas-control-core.ts` and pinned in its test, per the sync rule above.
  `queued:false` is NOT proof of a running CLI: Server's `deliveredIds` acknowledges terminal
  delivery only. Its initial commands are persisted before attach/send and retained on failure;
  only acknowledged sends clear them. Boot ownership remains fail-closed. Desktop `list` (live
  and stored projects) names QUEUED / LAUNCH FAILED / DROPPED / AGENT STATUS UNCONFIRMED rather
  than treating absence of a hook as success. Server v1 still explicitly refuses `list`.
  **(8) An armed node must not cold-start its own agent** (found while fixing (7)). The mount-time
  cold-restore relaunch (`fresh && agentId && canResume(...)`) carries a second, independent
  refusal beside the `paused` one (`shouldColdResume`): `!data.pendingLaunch`. A first open is
  `fresh` by definition, so every `--after` / `verify` node
  was launching a bare CLI on mount — the session the hold exists to prevent — and the held launch
  then arrived as TEXT typed into it rather than as the command it is. The delivery race used to
  mask it; gating delivery on the shell settling would have made it deterministic.
  **(9) An ERRORED upstream does not release its dependents** (issue #521, 2026-09).
  `--after` fires on idle, and a station whose turn dies on an API/model error reaches idle
  **immediately** — so a malformed-prompt station looked healthy from every surface an
  orchestrator can read, and the whole chain armed behind it launched on what it had not
  produced. The signal was already there and was being thrown away: claude and grok both fire
  **`StopFailure`** instead of `Stop` on an errored turn (already in `CLAUDE_HOOK_EVENTS` /
  `GROK_HOOK_EVENTS` — without the subscription the badge sticks on RUNNING), and both
  normalizers collapsed it to a plain `done`. It now carries **`errored`** on
  `NormalizedAgentEvent`, which `agentStatus` keeps as **`lastTurnError: {at}`**.
  Three things about the shape, each deliberate: (a) it is an **annotation, not a fifth
  `AgentState`** — an errored station IS idle, the two facts coexist, and a fifth state would
  ripple through both raw listeners, the parity test and the mobile mirror for a fact that is
  not a state; (b) it is set in `src/shared`'s normalizers, so **both shells change by
  construction** — there is nothing to keep in parity; (c) it is **TRANSIENT** like `state`,
  because after a relaunch nothing armed can fire anyway and a restored verdict would describe
  another app run's turn. It is **cleared by the next genuine new turn** — not by any
  intermediate transition, which says nothing about whether that turn produced something — so
  the refusal ends by itself when the station answers successfully. Firing with a WARNING was
  considered and dropped: a dependent that has launched cannot un-launch. Surfaces: a
  **TURN FAILED** chip on the node (red, no pulse — a verdict on a turn that is over, not
  something being waited for), the QUEUED tooltip naming the errored upstream instead of
  promising a wait, and a **`LAST TURN ERRORED` marker on the `list` rows** — on the ROW
  because a seven-station fan-out should cost one call to learn this, not seven. **No error
  TEXT is claimed**: whether the hook payload carries the failure message has not been
  measured, and `last_assistant_message` is the previous assistant turn rather than the error,
  so reporting it as "the error" would be a confident wrong fact. Reading the text, and the
  *failed-to-start* watchdog (a station that never emits ANY hook event — the opposite failure,
  which hangs dependents honestly rather than firing them wrongly), stay open.
  **Settings (`settings`, 2026-09):** `settings [--project <id>]` lists, `settings --get <key>`
  reads, `settings --set <key> --value <v> [--project <id>]` asks to change — flags only, because the
  shim drops a positional sub-action for an unlisted verb and an SSH host keeps the shim it got at
  connect. The pure `@shared/settings-verb` is the whole rule set, shared by the desktop dispatch, the
  Server Edition and main's `parseControlRequest`: an **allowlist** (`agentMessaging` per project;
  `snapToGrid`/`gridSize`/`defaultNodeWidth`/`defaultNodeHeight` machine-wide, bounds = the UI's) with
  a required `why` per entry, and a **forbidden set + name pattern that outranks it** (permission
  modes incl. `bypassPermissions`, `hookIdentityStrict`, `agentBrowserControl`, accounts/credentials/
  gateway/launch commands, telemetry, keybindings, confirm waivers, `capabilityAck`) — the test walks
  the table against both. Four load-bearing rules: (1) **every `--set` confirms**, and `settings` is
  in `DESTRUCTIVE_VERBS` (one dialog at a time) but NOT in `CONFIRM_WAIVABLE_VERBS` — no waiver of any
  scope, bypass included, answers for the user (`control-destructive.test.ts` pins no `waiveVerb`/no
  `controlConfirmDecision` in its block, and the write only on the confirm leg). (2) A capability read
  is the **grant** (`projectCapabilityGrantedFor`), never the file bit, and a capability write goes
  through `applySettingsChange` → the UI's own `setProjectCapability` (flag + `'kept'`), pinned by
  `settingsVerb.test.ts` comparing the two resulting projects. (3) Verified-only (`requiresVerified`)
  and `--project` is own-or-granted via `PROJECT_TARGETABLE_VERBS`/`gateProjectTarget`. (4) **Server
  Edition refuses every `--set` by name** — its headless opt-in (#537) is not consent to grant
  capabilities, and there is no dialog; `--get` answers from `capabilityProjectFor`, own project only.
  Mobile: N/A (the phone issues no control verbs).
  **Agent messaging's MACHINE DEFAULT (`settings.agentMessagingDefault`, 2026-09, ships OFF).** A
  project whose `.nodeterm/project.json` carries NO `agentMessaging` value is answered by this
  machine's settings.json; the rule is ONE function, `projectCapabilityEffective`
  (`@shared/project-capability-consent`), and `projectCapabilityGrantedFor` now REQUIRES the
  defaults argument so a consumer that forgot it fails to compile instead of reading every
  unconfigured project as off while Settings reads it as on. Four rules: (1) an explicit `true` still
  needs this machine's `'kept'` — `needsCapabilityNotice` is untouched and stays keyed on an explicit
  `true`, so a cloned file still notices and a project on only by default never does; (2) OFF is now
  WRITTEN — `setProjectCapability(…, false)` stores a literal `false` for a capability in
  `CAPABILITY_MACHINE_DEFAULTS` (browser control has none and still deletes the field), because
  absence now means "use the default"; `readProjectCapabilities` carries that `false` through the
  file; (3) an ABSENT field with a recorded `'declined'` stays off — that is how every pre-default
  build wrote "off", and a user's explicit no must not be undone by a default switched on later;
  "Use this machine's default" (`resetProjectCapabilityToDefault`) therefore clears the field AND the
  answer; (4) the default is forbidden to the `settings` verb (a grant over every project, clones
  included). **This does not trip the `project-capabilities.ts` header's trigger**: the notice is not
  dropped, and what the default answers is absence, whose value lives in machine-local settings.json.
  **Why it ships OFF:** `core/agents/pane-ownership.ts` records a pane's owner only on a FRESH spawn,
  so after an app restart or update every surviving pane is `unproven-target-owner` and refused —
  "on by default" would be false after every restart. The flip is a separate one-line change that
  waits for a cross-restart ownership proof (#659's signed record is the candidate). Settings →
  Agents shows the machine switch, and the per-project row is a three-way choice (default / on /
  off) plus "On in <project> (this machine's default)" — a two-position switch cannot draw absence.
  Downgrade: a pre-default build writes `false` back as a deleted field, which this build then reads
  as "use the default". Server Edition reads the same grant from its own settings.json; Mobile: N/A
  (the phone has no capability switch).
  **Review panel (`verify`, 2026-07):** `verify --node <id> [--lenses …] [--focus …] [--agent …]
  [--synthesis off]` opens one reviewer per LENS, each armed behind the target (`--after`) and
  bridged to it, wrapped in a `Verify: <title>` group, plus a judge armed behind the whole panel.
  It is **composition, not new machinery** — the two primitives above are the whole implementation.
  Prompt/lens logic is the pure, unit-tested `renderer/lib/verifyPanel.ts`; two wordings there are
  load-bearing and must not be "tightened away": reviewers are told **not to edit** (a panel is N
  agents pointed at ONE checkout — review and repair are different jobs, and only repair needs
  worktree isolation) and are explicitly **licensed to find nothing** (a reviewer under implicit
  pressure to produce findings invents them, and an invented finding costs someone else the time to
  disprove it). Unknown lens words are **kept** with a generic brief, not rejected — a table that
  only accepts what it already knows would be useless for the review nobody anticipated. Reviewers
  inherit the TARGET's `accountId` (its transcript resolves inside that account dir), not the
  caller's. The judge is armed on ids that exist only in that tick, which is why `armAfter` takes
  `extraLive` — without it the reviewers would look *deleted*, deletion counts as satisfied, and
  the judge would fire before a single review existed.
- **Context Link** — a node action gated by `CONTEXT_LINK_CAPABLE` (claude/codex/gemini/opencode/grok;
  custom agents + plain terminals excluded). **grok joined in 2026-09, and the file matters:** its
  readable conversation is `chat_history.jsonl`, NOT the `updates.jsonl` its own hook payloads
  advertise and this line used to name. Routing through the advertised path does not error — it opens
  a real file, parses nothing, and hands the linked agent an EMPTY transcript with no diagnostic, so
  a reader who trusts the old wording will build the silent failure this note exists to prevent
  (`core/handoff/locate.ts` pins it): drawing an edge between two builtin-agent nodes lets each
  READ the other's context on demand (pull, not push). Architecture (2026-07, SSH-capable — see
  docs/ssh-agent-skills.md): the **desktop does the reading AND the parsing**; the CLI the agent
  runs (`context.sh`) is a thin POSIX **sh+curl** shim that POSTs to the hook server's
  `/context-link/<verb>` route and prints the text/plain reply (the Electron-as-Node CLI is
  retired — its embedded-JS parser now lives as tested TS in `core/context-link-render.ts`:
  parsers for **all four** formats — claude JSONL / codex rollout / gemini event-sourced chat /
  opencode export — plus `renderContextLink` over injected fetchers). `src/core/context-link.ts`
  coalesces renderer updates before workspace-map construction with a non-resetting task.
  Intermediate ACL publications retain previously resolved paths keyed by node, agent, session,
  account, cwd, remote/local placement and hook path. Ingest prunes changed/removed identities,
  so changing back during queued discovery cannot revive an invalidated path. Reinitialization
  clears the cache, and only current-revision discovery may refill it. The service
  holds the link docs in memory (per-node files under `<userData>/context-links/` remain as a
  debug aid), carries per-entry `agentId`/`sessionId`/`accountId`, and answers the route;
  **authorization** = the doc is selected by the REQUESTER's node id, so a token-holding caller
  can only read nodes in its own (directional) link map. Codex/gemini paths resolve via the
  handoff locators (`locateCodex`/`locateGemini` by sessionId); claude keeps the hook-fed path +
  `locateClaude(sessionId, accountId)` fallback (cwd-newest is claude-only).
  `useContextLinkSync` publishes semantic map changes from live edges and subscribes to
  background project/status changes. Geometry/status render churn cannot postpone publication;
  relay-bound projects never enter the local core's map. A render-captured project epoch prevents
  outgoing live nodes replacing the incoming project's persisted map during a tab switch. Core
  replaces the read authorization map synchronously, then enriches/writes debug documents through
  a recoverable serialized queue; revision checks prevent obsolete enrichment restoring a removed
  link. Transcript paths can be temporarily unavailable while the current snapshot is enriched.
  **SSH projects:** the shim +
  skill are installed on the remote host at connect (`RemoteHooks.installContextLink`, gated on
  the VERIFIED reverse hook tunnel; POSTs ride `--unix-socket` through it); a remote node's
  transcript is read over the ControlMaster (`initContextLink(ptyManager, deps)` — `src/main`
  injects `isRemoteNode`/`readRemoteFile`/`runRemoteCommand`, bounded tail reads), its hook-fed
  path is jailed at ingest (`isSafeRemoteTranscriptPath`), and `resolveLinkTranscript` REFUSES
  the local locators for remote nodes (they'd resolve a stranger's local transcript). Server
  Edition IS wired (`src/server/context-link.ts` calls `initContextLink(ptyManager, {})`) but
  passes no remote deps → **local-only**, which is the complete answer there: that shell runs ON the
  host whose transcripts and tmux it reads, and SSH projects are a desktop-only concept. Discovery is per-agent: claude installs a
  `get-linked-context` skill; codex/gemini get an idempotent marker block
  (`<!-- nodeterm:get-linked-context:start/end -->`) merged into `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` /
  `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md`. On connect an idle-gated one-line note is injected into each endpoint
  (claude → skill pointer; codex/gemini → inline CLI command via `contextLink.info()`).
  (Replaced the earlier MCP-based bridge.)
  **Note links:** a sticky note can be connected to ANY terminal node (one-way, sticky →
  terminal). On connect, agent sessions get a one-shot idle-gated push of the note text
  (`buildNotePushMessage`, single-line, truncated at 2000 chars); plain terminals get no
  push (sendText appends Enter — the text would execute). The note's live text also rides
  the link file (`ContextLinkInfo.note`), so Claude reads the current text via the
  get-linked-context CLI (`summary`/`transcript` print it; `list` marks `(note)`). Pure
  edge/push/map logic in `renderer/lib/noteLink.ts`.
- **Managed Claude accounts** (Claude-only) — run several logged-in Claude identities side by
  side by giving each its own config dir. `settings.claudeAccounts` is a list of `ClaudeAccount
  {id, label, email?, host?, pending?, createdAt}` (in `settings.json`; the account **list** is
  config, not credentials). Isolation is **config-dir**, not token storage: a local account's dir
  is `{userData}/claude-accounts/<id>` (`claudeConfigDirFor` / pure `accountConfigDir`),
  a **remote** account's is `~/.nodeterm/claude-accounts/<id>` on its `host` (keyed by
  `sshHostKey` = `user@host`; `remoteAccountConfigDir` is `~`-relative for ssh expansion,
  `remoteAccountConfigDirAbs` resolves it against the connection's `remoteHome`). The **claude
  CLI owns login, credential storage, and token refresh** inside that dir — the app NEVER writes
  credentials. On macOS this works because Claude Code **≥ 2.1** scopes its Keychain service per
  config dir (`Claude Code-credentials-<sha256(configDir)[:8]>`, `claudeKeychainService`); on
  < 2.1 one unscoped service is shared → accounts collide, so add-account **warns** (`claude
  --version`, `isSupportedClaudeVersion`).
  - **`data.accountId` (terminal nodes)** — resolved **once at node creation**
    (`resolveNewNodeAccount`: explicit submenu pick → `project.defaultAccountId` → system default
    `~/.claude`), then **persisted** (serializers) and changed ONLY by an explicit **account switch**
    (below). `undefined` = system default
    = **bit-for-bit legacy behavior** (no env touched). Inherited by **Branch** (the
    terminal→chat fork it also fed is gone — the SDK chat node was removed 2026-07). Two #419
    rules inside the resolver: the submenu's **System row passes `null`** (an EXPLICIT system
    pick that skips the project default — before that, the row wearing the system email launched
    the project-default account), and validation runs against `accountsForProject`, not the raw
    list, so a **pending** account or one **pinned to another machine's host** is never stamped
    onto a node it cannot run on (both used to reach the missing-dir fallback at spawn).
  - **Switch Claude account (running node)** — node right-click → *Switch Claude
    account ▸* moves the conversation onto another account **already logged in** on this machine,
    with no `/login` in the pane. It works because a transcript carries **no account identity**
    (measured on 2.1.280: under a config dir lacking the file `--resume` says "No conversation found";
    with the file copied into `<configDir>/projects/<encoded cwd>/<id>.jsonl` only the login is
    missing). Choreography = "Restart agent and shell" with a `beforeRecycle` step
    (`agent-restart.ts`): exit the CLI (refused while working/blocked) → core
    `claudeAccounts.copySession` (`core/claude-session-copy.ts`) → rebind `accountId` → recycle, whose
    respawn gets the new `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` and whose cold restore resumes the same id. Two rules:
    the copy runs **after** the exit, so the source is final and a target that is a byte-**prefix**
    of it is just an older copy (A→B→A) and may be replaced, while a **diverged** target is never
    overwritten; and the rebind is **returned** by `beforeRecycle` and merged into the closure's own
    `updateNodeData`, never set by a separate Canvas `setNodes` in the same tick (React Flow's update
    queue rebuilds the node from the store's copy and can drop it). Builtin `claude` only (the
    `boundAccountId` rule below). **SSH nodes** switch between the accounts pinned to THEIR host (and
    the host's own `~/.claude`): the copy runs ON the host as one generated `sh` script over the
    project's master (`core/remote-claude-session-copy.ts`, tested under a real `/bin/sh`; same
    prefix/diverged rule, via `head -c | cmp`), and `SshProjectManager.remoteClaudeSessionCopy`
    refuses an account pinned to another host. An SSH ctx with no remote leg (Server Edition) is
    refused, never answered from the local disk. Relay tabs: shown disabled.
    **Two more surfaces, one choreography** (`runClaudeAccountSwitch` returns a
    `ClaudeSwitchOutcome` instead of announcing it): the **kanban card** right-click menu gets the
    node's rows from the SAME builder the canvas node menu uses (`accountSwitchRows` → KanbanView's
    `accountMenuItems`), and the **usage popover** puts "⇄ Move N sessions" on each account row —
    every Claude session on this canvas running on that account, on the popover's machine
    (`bulkSwitchCandidates`), is moved to the picked account ONE AT A TIME (N parallel copies +
    recycles on one host is a load spike), busy ones skipped and counted, one summary line
    (`summarizeBulkSwitch`). The cross-project board (GlobalKanbanView) does not offer it:
    its cards belong to other projects' canvases, whose nodes have no restart closure mounted.
  - **`boundAccountId(accountId, agentId)` (`shared/agents/account-binding.ts`) is the ONE rule for
    whether a node is account-bound at all**, and it feeds `data.accountId` *and* the account color
    from a single decision — split them and a node carries an account it is not painted for, or is
    painted for one it does not carry. Two surfaces mint nodes and both ask it: `createAgentNode`
    (canvas) and `appendProjectNode` (the phone's `projects.registerNode`, which used to write
    whatever the wire sent, so a gemini node could come back bound to a Claude account). Managed
    accounts belong to the builtin **claude and codex** (S6); a **known** other agent — builtin or
    custom, since a custom agent inheriting one of those harnesses is still its own agent — never
    binds. **An UNSTATED agent keeps its binding** — the asymmetry is deliberate: the phone chooses
    `agentId` and `accountId` independently and is not known to always send the first
    (docs/ios-protocol-migration.md §6), dropping a real binding is the wrong-identity bug the
    field exists to prevent, while a stray one on an agent-less node only sets a config-home
    variable nothing reads. On the canvas `agentId` is always stated, so that path is bit-for-bit
    what it was. `main` resolves the color off the RAW id and lets the registrar refuse it, rather
    than re-deriving the gate at the call site.
  - **Account default node color (`ClaudeAccount.color` / `CodexAccount.color`, optional)** — a
    per-account default node color (Settings → Accounts) that beats the agent's own brand color in
    `createAgentNode`, so a second login is recognizable on the canvas. Read off the SAME
    `boundAccountId` that stamps `data.accountId`, so the color and the binding cannot drift.
    Applied **at creation** and baked into `data.color` like any other node color: a hand-picked
    node color is never overwritten and editing the account later repaints nothing. Unset / stale
    id / an agent that takes no managed account ⇒ the agent's color, unchanged.
    **Which list answers is `agentAccountColor`'s alone** (`shared/agents/account-color.ts`, one
    definition shared by `createAgentNode` and the phone-registered node path in `src/main`):
    claude reads `claudeAccounts`, codex reads `codexAccounts`, everything else reads nothing. The
    two lists are keyed **independently** — nothing stops the same id appearing in both — so a node
    colored from the other list would be repainted from a stranger's row; the swatch UI is one
    component (`AccountColorSwatches`) rendered by both row kinds for the same reason.
    The value is **re-validated as a string** at the read: the account lists come out of a
    hand-editable settings.json that nothing checks field-by-field on load, and a `"color": 123`
    would throw on `.trim()` INSIDE `createAgentNode` — stopping every new node under that account
    from opening, with nothing pointing back at the edited file.
  - **Env injection** — `pty-manager` sets `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` in the spawn env AND as a tmux `-e`
    (local); for a remote node it emits an **absolute-path** remote tmux `-e` built from the
    connection-cached `remoteHome` (skipped **fail-open** if home is unresolved). `AUTH_ENV_STRIP`
    (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` / `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`) is deleted from the
    child env so a stray env key can't shadow the account. A **missing** account dir → warn +
    silent system fallback. **The account-scope names ride the LOCAL conf's `update-environment`
    (`ACCOUNT_SCOPE_UPDATE_ENV`, issue #419)** — the shared tmux server inherits the env of the
    client that STARTS it, so a server started by a managed-account node used to leak that
    account's `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` (and any un-stripped auth key) into every session created
    without a `-e` override: system nodes, plain terminals and the missing-dir fallback silently
    ran as that account ("the system account is entangled with the next account in the list").
    Listing the names makes tmux copy each from the creating client's env and **strip it when the
    client lacks it** (proven against a real tmux in `account-env.realtmux.test.ts`, seeded-server
    case included; `ensureUpdateEnvKeys` retrofits a long-lived pre-fix server). The same listing
    is what makes codex's explicit system-scope overwrite (`CODEX_HOME` /
    `NODETERM_CODEX_ACCOUNT_ID`) actually reach sessions on a shared server. **LOCAL conf only**
    — the remote conf must NOT get these names: a remote attach client's env is the login
    shell's, and the copy/strip would run against that wrong environment (pinned in
    `ssh.test.ts`).
  - **Login flow** — Settings → Accounts → **Add** creates a `pending` account and drops a canvas
    **login node** that runs `claude /login` under the account dir. Core polls the dir's
    `.claude.json` (`LOGIN_POLL_MS` 2 s, up to `LOGIN_TIMEOUT_MS` 5 min) for `oauthAccount.email`;
    on capture the account flips out of `pending` with its email as the default label. Account
    removal cancels any pending wait + `markDirty`. **Codex accounts have the same two halves** —
    `createCodexAccountLoginNode` (`codex login`, title "Codex login") behind the
    `nodeterm:add-codex-account-login` listener, with `codexAccounts.waitLogin` polling the managed
    home's `auth.json`. Both flows mint an **agent-less terminal** carrying only `accountId`, and
    that shape is why `needsCodexAccountScope` takes an `isCodexAccount` resolver rather than
    reading `!!accountId`: the two account lists share an id alphabet, so the id alone cannot say
    which provider it belongs to. Guessing "codex" refused every managed **Claude** node (#345);
    guessing "not codex" would let `codex login` write into the system `~/.codex`. A dispatch with
    no listener is a silent no-op, which is how the Codex half shipped inert (#346) — pinned now by
    `renderer/lib/nodeterm-events.test.ts`, which fails on any `nodeterm:*` event that is sent but
    never heard. **All THREE login factories take a `cwd`** (`createAccountLoginNode`,
    `createCodexAccountLoginNode`, `createSystemLoginNode`), and every call site passes the active
    project's — a login node with none starts in `$HOME`, and an agent CLI whose trust check is
    keyed on the cwd (Claude Code's is) then asks the user to trust their entire home directory,
    SSH keys and cloud credentials included, before an OAuth round trip that touches no files
    (issue #553; a persisted "yes" there grants that workspace for good). It is not a promise the
    prompt disappears — an untrusted project still prompts — it makes it the exception rather than
    the rule, without nodeterm writing another tool's trust config on the user's behalf. A
    **remote** login ignores the local path: `createTerminalNode` prefers `ssh.remoteCwd`, which is
    the only cwd that means anything for a session running on the host. An SSH project has no local
    `cwd`, so a LOCAL account added from one still opens in `$HOME` — the honest answer, since that
    project owns no local directory.
  - **The lifecycle is CORE, and both shells register it** (issue #313) —
    `core/claude-accounts-service.ts` owns the five `claude-accounts:*` channels (add / wait-login
    / cancel-wait / remove / link) behind `platform().handle`; `main/claude-accounts.ts` is a thin desktop
    wrapper and `registerCoreHandlers` calls the same `registerClaudeAccountsIpc()`. Two optional
    deps carry everything core cannot reach: `installSkill` (desktop passes `installCanvasSkillInto`;
    an enabled Server canvas-control runtime installs its Server-specific skill separately) and
    `remote`, a **thunk** resolving the SSH legs
    (desktop's manager is created after the registration, and the server has none — in both cases
    an `AccountCtx` carrying a `projectId` degrades to the LOCAL path, which is the pre-existing
    behavior this preserves). **Three surfaces:** Desktop unchanged (same channels, same shapes,
    same remote fallbacks); **Server Edition** now full — real `buildClaudeAccountsApi` over the
    ws-bridge (the 5-min `waitLogin` is a straight passthrough because RpcClient has no request
    timeout), minus SSH accounts and the canvas skill; **Mobile: N/A** — the phone launches with
    the accounts the agent-status mirror advertises and never mints one. **Managed CODEX accounts
    stay desktop-only** and their bridge namespace stays an `E_UNSUPPORTED` stub: the switch verbs
    authorize the owning window by Electron WebContents id, which has no meaning over a WS
    connection. The Settings section now *names* that refusal instead of leaving an unhandled
    promise rejection — a spinner that stops and says nothing reads as a dead button.
  - **Hook install** — the managed hook is merged into **each account dir's** `settings.json` at
    add-account **and** at app launch (local, shared `install-helper.ts`) / via
    `RemoteHooks.installIntoAccountDir` (remote), so every identity reports agent status. The
    launch-time loop is ONE function (`installHooksIntoLocalAccounts`, beside the service) that
    both shells call — the desktop passing the canvas skill as its `extra`. A second copy is the
    drift this file warns about elsewhere: the Server Edition shipped without the per-account leg
    entirely, so a managed account there reported no agent status at all.
  - **Shared system skills (`shareSystemSkills`, issue #643, OFF by default)** — Claude Code resolves
    user skills as `join(CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR ?? ~/.claude, 'skills')` (MEASURED, 2.1.266), so an
    account dir **replaces** `~/.claude/skills` rather than adding to it and a fresh managed account
    shows only the skills nodeterm installed (that was #438). The isolation is correct and often the
    point; this per-account switch (Settings → Accounts) is the way back in.
    **Each system skill is linked INDIVIDUALLY** (`<accountDir>/skills/<name>` →
    `~/.claude/skills/<name>`), never the whole `skills` directory, and that choice is what makes
    everything else safe: `installCanvasSkillInto` writes *into* `<configDir>/skills/`, so a
    directory-level link would put nodeterm's canvas skill in the user's SYSTEM skills folder, and
    "turn it off" would have to restore a directory it had first moved aside. Per-skill links keep
    the account's `skills/` a real directory and make the off-switch a link removal.
    MEASURED with strace: Claude Code opens a symlinked entry inside `skills/` as a directory and
    reads its `SKILL.md` exactly like a real sibling — per-skill links are equivalent to the
    whole-directory link for discovery, not a compromise.
    - **Ownership is name-anchored**: an entry is ours iff it is a symlink whose target normalizes
      to exactly `join(systemSkillsDir, <that entry's own name>)`. What ON creates is precisely what
      OFF removes; a real directory is never ours, whatever its name — so "never delete through the
      link" is a property of the plan (`core/claude-skill-share-core.ts`, pure + mutation-tested),
      not a promise about the applier. Removal is `unlink` then `rmdir` (a Windows junction refuses
      `unlink`); both fail on a real non-empty directory, which is the second line of defence.
    - **`NODETERM_OWNED_SKILLS` (`manage-nodeterm-canvas`, `get-linked-context`) is never linked and
      never pruned.** Their presence in an account dir is decided by nodeterm's own installers; if
      sharing linked them, the off-switch would delete a skill the canvas-control installer had put
      there and the two owners would fight over the name at every launch.
    - **The realpath refusal is load-bearing.** The issue's manual workaround
      (`mv skills skills.bak && ln -s ~/.claude/skills skills`) makes the account's `skills/`
      RESOLVE to the system one; linking into it would plant links in the user's own folder and let
      the off-switch delete them from there. The planner compares REAL paths and refuses
      (`same-directory`), which also covers a linked account whose `configDir` was hand-edited to
      `~/.claude`.
    - **Windows uses a directory JUNCTION** (`fs.symlink(target, path, 'junction')`), not the `'dir'`
      symlink `worktree-shared-paths.ts` must use: a junction needs neither Developer Mode nor
      elevation, and every target here is an absolute directory — the two conditions it has. On
      POSIX Node ignores the type. So the feature is available on every desktop platform rather than
      gated off one.
    - **The launch sweep re-links but NEVER removes** (`installHooksIntoLocalAccounts`). ON has real
      work at boot (a skill added to `~/.claude/skills` since the last run; a stale link to prune);
      OFF is a removal, and ownership here is inferred from a link's SHAPE, which cannot tell our
      link from an identical hand-made one — and a LINKED account's dir is the user's own
      `~/.claude-2`, where exactly that is a normal thing to find. Removal therefore happens only
      through `claude-accounts:set-skill-sharing`, where the intent is explicit. The cost: a
      settings.json hand-edited to `false` while the app was closed keeps its links until the switch
      is flipped.
    - **The switch flips the filesystem FIRST and persists the flag only if that returned** — the
      flag is what the sweep replays, so a stored `true` whose links were never made would make the
      switch lie until the next boot. A refusal stores nothing.
    - **The copy says the edits flow both ways**, because a link is not a copy: editing a shared
      skill from inside the account edits the machine's own file. A user who reads "share" as "copy"
      finds that out by losing work. Result sentences are the pure `renderer/lib/skillSharing.ts`.
    - **Surfaces.** Desktop: full. **Server Edition: full** — the whole implementation is core, so
      the ws-bridge leg is a real passthrough and the machine the browser is served from is exactly
      the machine whose `~/.claude/skills` is shared (the canvas skill is not installed there, but
      its name stays reserved: a reserved name that is never created is inert). **SSH accounts:
      explicitly out of scope for v1** — their config dir is on the host, so the option would have to
      link that host's skills over the ControlMaster, with its own generated-shell proof obligation.
      The switch is DISABLED with that reason (never hidden), and core refuses (`remote-account`) as
      the backstop for a hand-edited settings.json. **Mobile: N/A** — the phone never mints an
      account and carries no skills concept.
  - **Account-aware readers** — transcript resolution is scoped per account (`transcriptRootFor`
    picks the account dir's `projects/`, composite cache key includes `accountId`); the same
    threading runs through the session-name poll, restart handoff, and `ChatPanel` (the ⌘M
    transcript view, `chat.readTranscript`). The **usage indicator** is per account (`claude-usage.ts`: scoped Keychain
    service only for managed accounts, then their credentials file; popover lists a row per account with **System**
    first). **Remote (SSH host) accounts are included** — see **Remote usage** below.
  - **Pickers** — New Claude exposes an account **submenu** (pane menu; flat entries in
    the dock; palette commands; TabBar sets the **per-project default**). A **local** project
    lists local accounts, an **SSH** project lists only accounts whose `host` matches its
    connection; both offer a **System account** option. An SSH project whose host has **no**
    matching accounts gets a disabled hint row instead of a bare System-only list
    (`sshAccountsHint` — pane submenu, dock, TabBar; the palette deliberately omits it: a
    disabled row would surface as a search result) saying accounts for this host are added in
    Settings → Accounts while the project is connected — local accounts being invisible there is
    correct (their credentials aren't on the host) but read as "multi-account is broken on SSH".
  - **Remote accounts** — selection + login + env injection, plus **usage** (below); no
    per-account transcript readers beyond env.
  - **Settings → Accounts is ONE machine-grouped surface for BOTH providers** (2026-09): a panel
    per machine (this one, then each saved SSH server ∪ the active project's server — a saved server
    with no accounts and no connection is folded into a footnote count), each holding a Claude and a
    Codex block with the SAME row, system row and Add button (`groupAccountsByMachine`). A remote
    machine's Add / Retry / Remove act ON that host over a **connected** project only — a
    disconnected host's Add is disabled and its Remove only forgets the record (the dialog says so);
    a remote id never reaches a LOCAL remove. Codex gained the remote lifecycle this needed:
    `codexAccounts.add/waitLogin/identity/remove` take an SSH `ctx` (desktop `src/main/codex-accounts.ts`
    → the `SshProjectManager.remoteCodex*` legs; the credential is written on the host by
    `codex login --device-auth` — the default browser flow calls back to the HOST's localhost), and
    `systemIdentity({projectId})` now asks the host instead of answering `null`.
  - **The remote spawn scopes the account BY PROVIDER** (`core/remote-account-env.ts`). It used to
    hand every `accountId` to Claude's `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, so a node bound to a managed Codex account
    on an SSH host got a Claude dir that does not exist and NO `CODEX_HOME` — its codex silently ran
    as the host's system login (`remoteCodexTmuxEnvArgs` existed with no caller). The system Codex
    account is left to the host's own env (a remote `CODEX_HOME` of the user's — a snap remap — must
    win).
  - **Switch Codex account on an SSH node** (2026-09) does NOT use the local three-phase reservation
    (it plans rollouts in LOCAL homes). It is one host-side exposure —
    `codexAccounts.switchThreadRemote` → `SshProjectManager.remoteCodexSwitchThread` →
    `remoteCodexExposeThread` (relay `expose-thread`): resolve the thread across every account
    catalog on the host, hardlink the one authoritative rollout into the target home, verify the
    target's app-server discovers it, roll the link back if not; an ambiguous thread is refused.
    Then the usual still-eligible check and a restart-shell recycle, with the rebind riding
    `beforeRecycle` (never a separate setNodes). A hardlink, not a copy: both accounts see ONE file,
    so there is no diverged-copy case. Needs the relay runtime on the host (node + codex + curl);
    without it the switch fails with a notice and nothing changes. `planCodexAccountSwitch` now
    refuses a target on another machine than the node (`hostKey`) — the switch never crosses
    machines (moving a local conversation to a host is `transferThreadToSsh`, a separate flow).
  - **Linked accounts** (`ClaudeAccount.configDir`) — a PRE-EXISTING local config
    dir the user already drives themselves (`export CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.claude-2; claude …` in a
    plain terminal) adopted as a first-class account without a login node. Settings → Accounts →
    **Link existing config dir…** (or one click on a **Detected** dir) calls `claude-accounts:link`
    (core service): `~` expansion → `normalizeLinkedConfigDir` → string-only refusals (the system
    `~/.claude`, anything under `{userData}/claude-accounts`, an already-linked path) → `stat` →
    email from `<dir>/.claude.json` (missing = `email: null`, not an error) → managed hook install.
    `claudeConfigDirFor(id)` consults a **registered accounts source**
    (`registerClaudeAccountsSource`, both shells right after `settingsStore.init()` — BEFORE the
    mirror settings provider can flush, or the phone would be advertised a non-existent managed
    dir), so env injection, `transcriptRootFor`, the transcript index, usage rows and the pickers
    all resolve a linked id to the user's own dir with no per-caller branch. The transcript jails
    (`isSafeLocalTranscriptPath`, both raw listeners) accept `<linkedDir>/projects/**` for dirs
    **from settings only** — never a dir named by the POST. **Removing a linked account only
    forgets the record**: the `rm -rf` names `accountConfigDir(userData, id)` directly, so it is
    structurally incapable of reaching outside the managed root even if the settings row is gone
    before the IPC lands. The hook installer resolves `settings.json` symlinks and atomically updates their target
    (without replacing the link) — a profile whose `settings.json` symlinks to `~/.claude/settings.json` (the
    two-profile layout) stays a symlink; pinned by `claude-accounts-link-symlink.test.ts`, and
    switching that write to `renameAtomic` would be the regression (it replaces the link).
  - **Observed account** (`ObservedClaudeAccount`, `NormalizedAgentEvent.account`) — which account
    a session is ACTUALLY on, derived by the hook server from the payload's `transcript_path`
    (`<configDir>/projects/<slug>/<session>.jsonl`; `configDirFromTranscriptPath` walks up to the
    LAST `projects` segment, so `~/projects/.claude/projects/…` names `~/projects/.claude`, not
    `~`). `classifyClaudeConfigDir` is pure string matching, host-agnostic: managed local root →
    managed remote pattern (`…/.nodeterm/claude-accounts/<id>`) → linked (settings) → any
    `…/.claude` ⇒ system (`accountId: null`) → else `known: false`. It is a **LABEL** exactly like
    `verified`/`clientRevision`: attached to the normalized event in ONE place (the hook server),
    so both shells inherit it and neither raw listener changes; claude events only; never throws;
    **never reads the filesystem** (a forged POST naming `~/.ssh/projects/x` gets `known: false`
    and nothing is opened). Recorded by the mirror (`MirrorEntry.account`) and the renderer store
    (`agentStatus.account`, persisted like `agentId` — a hand-launched claude's identity exists
    nowhere else). **Effective account for READERS** = `data.accountId ?? observed.accountId`
    (`renderer/lib/accountChip.ts` `effectiveAccountId`): `readSessionName`, `context.ensure`, the
    transcript search and the ⌘M view use it; **spawn/env never does** (launch identity stays
    creation-time). The **account chip** (`components/AccountChip.tsx`, ONE component on the node
    header, kanban card, card modal and sidebar row) shows for any non-system account, and for
    system panes only when ≥ 2 distinct account keys (`sys` / `<id>` / `ext:<dir>`) are live on the
    core (`hasMultipleAccountKeys`, a primitive selector so headers don't re-render on every hook
    event). An unlinked dir is named by its last path segment (`.claude-2`, dashed chip) with a
    tooltip pointing at Settings → Accounts, where **Detected config dirs** lists it for one-click
    linking. Mobile: N/A (additive mirror fields).

- **Active Claude organization** (#552) — local Desktop and Server usage snapshots carry optional
  `organization` metadata from the SAME account's `.claude.json` (system, managed or linked).
  Read it even if Keychain/file credentials already have an email; unreadable/missing metadata
  preserves the email and usage. A known email mismatch drops metadata. Managed usage cannot use
  an unscoped Keychain token: a matching email alone does not prove it belongs to the same org.
  The popover names the org beneath the email; internal type/tier/id remain tooltip details.
  Refresh re-reads metadata together with usage; normal cache/poll intervals still apply.
  SSH's existing shell reader does not supply organization metadata and keeps its email-only
  fallback. Mobile's usage mirror currently omits it; displaying orgs there needs a follow-up
  mirror/iOS protocol change. No organization picker, credential writes or switching are added.

- **Bottom chrome shares a measured width budget** (issue #853). `CanvasPills` observes the canvas
  wrapper and actual dock, bounds the left row with an 8px gap, and uses a row above the dock when
  fewer than 200 CSS pixels remain. Rects are converted back through UI scale. Usage summary text
  ellipsizes; refresh never shrinks. Do not clip the whole row or give it a stacking context:
  usage/RAM popovers must escape independently above the sidebar and board. Desktop and Server
  share this renderer. The real-browser regression is `scripts/usage-layout.test.ts` (`CHROME_BIN`).

- **The usage indicator is scoped to the ACTIVE project** (`renderer/lib/usageScope.ts`, pure +
  unit-tested) — it describes **the machine that project runs on**, and nothing else. A local
  project shows this machine (system + managed local accounts + the billing providers, whose
  credentials are all local); an **SSH project shows that host's Claude and Codex accounts** — no local
  Claude, no local providers, no other host. Without this the panel showed every source at once:
  each addition was individually reasonable and the sum was unreadable, numbers from three
  machines sharing one line with nothing saying which was which. Deliberately NOT narrowed to the
  project's `defaultAccountId`: the local side lists every local identity, so the machine is the
  scope and the account is a row within it. The pill spells out the scoped machine's **system**
  account (falling back to the first identity with data, so a host used only through a managed
  login isn't blank), managed accounts stay popover-only — the rule the local side always had.
  `usageScopeKey`/`scopeFromKey` exist because the active project object is rebuilt on every node
  serialization: the zustand selector returns ONE primitive so the indicator doesn't re-render on
  every canvas edit. ⟳ refreshes only what is on screen, and `usage.remote({hostKey})` reads only
  that host (cache eviction still runs against the FULL target list, so switching between two SSH
  projects doesn't throw each host's cache away).

- **Grok billing failures** retain per-view HTTP status or a safe timeout/network/invalid-response category in `ProviderUsage.diagnostics`. The default view still runs after a credits failure; recovered limits keep their diagnostic. Only two successful empty views imply no quota. Never include raw exceptions, URLs or response bodies, or refresh/write credentials. Desktop and Server share the core reader and popover; provider-only errors must keep the pill visible.

- **Usage failure readouts** — an empty Claude snapshot with `status: error` says "Could not
  read usage." in both the single-account and multi-account popovers, including beside healthy
  provider rows. Nonempty snapshots retain their last-known bars on error; no error-specific
  authentication advice is inferred from the status.

- **Remote usage** (SSH hosts, `src/core/usage/remote-claude-usage.ts`) — the source behind the
  SSH scope above. v1 excluded remote accounts, which left a user whose Claude only ever runs on a
  server staring at an empty indicator while the host had perfectly good numbers.
  **The token never leaves the host.** The desktop could `cat` the remote `.credentials.json` and
  call the API itself — it already reads remote transcripts over the same master — but a bearer
  token pulled off a (possibly shared) server into another machine's memory buys nothing: the host
  can make the request itself. So core generates a POSIX **sh+curl** command, the shell runs it
  over the project's ControlMaster, and only the JSON answer comes back. Three details are
  load-bearing:
  1. **The token is piped into `curl --config -`, never `-H` on the command line** — argv is
     world-readable via `ps` on a shared host.
  2. **`.credentials.json` holds more than one `accessToken`** — every MCP server the CLI has
     authorized keeps its own under `mcpOAuth`. The extraction narrows to the `claudeAiOauth`
     object first (exactly as the local `parseCreds` does), because grabbing the file's first match
     sends an MCP token to the endpoint, earns a 401, and reports a signed-in host as signed out.
     Caught only by running the command against a REAL credentials file — which is why
     `remote-claude-usage.test.ts` runs the generated script under a real `/bin/sh` against a fake
     `$HOME` + fake `curl`, the same discipline as the canvas-control shim.
  3. **A read that could not run is `error`, never `unavailable`** — a dead master says nothing
     about whether the account has a subscription, and 'unavailable' silently drops the row.
  Shape: `remoteUsageTargets` (pure) elects ONE connected project per host (several projects share
  a host's `$HOME`) and offers its system `~/.claude` plus every managed account pinned to that
  host. The service (`usage:remote`) caches per target under the usual debounce, evicts targets
  whose host disconnected, and coalesces concurrent reads. **On demand, never polled** — each row
  is an ssh exec plus an HTTPS request on someone else's machine; the renderer asks on mount, on
  popover open, on ⟳, and when the active project's connection comes up (an SSH project is opened
  before its master is ready). Deps are injected exactly like
  Context Link's (`src/main` supplies the ControlMaster; **Server Edition passes none** ⇒ `[]`, so
  the UI needs no capability check). Own Settings switch (`claude-remote`), because hiding local
  Claude usage must not silently take the hosts down with it. **Mobile: N/A** — the
  slice pushed to a host still drops `usage` (a host reading its own numbers back off us is
  pointless), and no keychain leg exists remotely (a headless macOS host would hang on the prompt,
  so a mac host reports nothing).

- **Codex SSH usage** (`core/usage/remote-codex-usage.ts`) uses host-side Node JSON parsing
  and curl, reusing the local Codex quota mapper. Read only `tokens.access_token` and
  `tokens.account_id`; pass headers through stdin, disable curl config/redirects, and return
  only sanitized quota fields. Never download credentials, refresh tokens, or launch a remote
  app-server just to refresh usage. The host needs Node and curl; missing tools/transport or
  malformed responses are errors, not proof of a logged-out account. System reads use the
  host login environment's `CODEX_HOME`; managed reads use the validated account's remote
  home. Cache identity includes provider, host, account and connection/home identity.
  Remote Codex rows obey the Codex visibility setting and carry no Claude default-account
  or bulk-move actions. Desktop supports SSH reads; Server Edition keeps its local core
  readers and absent SSH dependency. The private mobile reader is separate. Device checks:
  `docs/codex-ssh-metrics.md`.

### Adding a new agent (or a new model) — what to watch out for

Every rule below is a mistake the grok branch or the codex/gemini-parity branch **actually made**, and
each one cost a review round or shipped a wrong number to the user. Read the concrete failure, not the
principle. Per-agent write-ups: `docs/grok-agent.md`, `docs/gemini-agent.md`.

**The mechanism**

1. **A capability is a membership list plus ONE leaf.** Add the id to the list in
   `src/shared/agents/config.ts`, write the one per-agent thing that list gates (a normalizer, a
   reader, a table row), and every consumer lights up — the whole point of the design. What you must
   never do is fork behavior at a call site with `=== 'claude'`; ask through the helper.
2. **Ask what ELSE the list gates before joining it.** `hasUsage` gated **three** features, not one.
   Joining `USAGE_CAPABLE` for the context meter also switched on `context.ensure` and the find bar's
   transcript index, both of which resolve through *claude's* `resolveTranscript` — whose **cwd
   fallback** then handed a codex node **the newest claude transcript for that cwd**: a stranger's
   session as its meter (wrong numerator *and* denominator, flapping against the correct tail) and that
   session's messages as its search hits. Preconditions were default-true, so it would have shipped.
   The fix was a new pure predicate (`readsClaudeTranscript`) reusing an existing list, not a fourth
   list meaning the same thing. **Grep every consumer of the helper before you add an id to its list.**
3. **A read leg and a write leg are different facts, and may need different lists.** Gemini names its
   own sessions but has **no rename command**, so `TITLE_READ_CAPABLE` (read) split from
   `RENAME_CAPABLE` (write), with `read ⊇ write` pinned as an invariant. One list would have lit the
   rename UI on a node where the write silently does nothing — the worst kind of feature, one that
   looks like it worked.
4. **State Desktop / Server Edition / Mobile for the capability, even when the answer is "N/A".**
   Put the logic in `src/core` behind `CorePlatform` or the Server Edition silently doesn't have it,
   and give `window.nodeTerminal` a REAL bridge implementation or a documented degrade — a `noop` stub
   compiles fine while doing nothing. (Live example: the session-title READ has no server handler at
   all, so it is stubbed for **claude too** — a pre-existing gap that keeps being rediscovered per
   agent.)

**Measuring the CLI**

5. **Measure the CLI; do not assume claude's shape.** Three real bugs, all from assuming:
   - grok's `--` is **end-of-options**, so a flag appended *after* the prompt separator is a
     positional — silently swallowed into the prompt, or a clap usage error that kills the launch.
     Where the flag lands is decided at the **composed** layer (`createAgentNode`); a
     `withPermissionMode` unit test passes while the composed line is wrong.
   - codex's `total_token_usage` is **CUMULATIVE**, not the live context: against its own window it
     rendered a 13%-full session at **79%** and would have crossed 100% two turns later. The right
     field is `last_token_usage`.
   - `cached` tokens are **INSIDE** `input` for codex and gemini, and **OUTSIDE** it for claude (whose
     reader therefore sums them). Copying claude's formula double-counts. **Do not unify the
     formulas.**
6. **Prefer the agent's own stated number over one you infer.** Codex prints
   `model_context_window` right beside its usage — use it. When there is none, mirror the CLI's own
   resolver rather than building a per-model allowlist: gemini's `tokenLimit()` is a family rule with
   a **1M catch-all default**, so an unreleased model gets the *right* answer where an allowlist would
   be confidently wrong, silently. **And if you cannot establish a trustworthy denominator, ship no
   meter** — a percentage over a guessed window is a wrong number presented as a fact. This used to
   cite grok as the example of having no meter; grok turned out to be the BEST case for this rule,
   stating `contextTokensUsed`, `contextWindowTokens` **and** the resulting `contextWindowUsage` in
   `signals.json` (all three present in 22 of 22 measured sessions, and the stated percentage agrees
   with the division in all 22 — an oracle pinned as a test). What was missing was never the number:
   it was a comment nobody could check, naming the wrong file.
7. **A closed set beats a substring, for notification/event types.** Grok's
   `type.includes('permission')` matched a notification grok fires before *every* tool call, so a
   working node strobed NEEDS YOU: unread dot + chime + OS notification + phone inbox card, per tool
   call. Gemini is matched `=== 'ToolPermission'` and stays quiet on an unknown type. A badge stuck on
   a finished node has no later hook to clear it, so widening "to be safe" is the unsafe direction.
8. **"Supports" can be as dishonest as "doesn't support."** Codex claimed `manual` / "Ask each time"
   while emitting **no flag** — but its built-in default is `OnRequest` ("the model decides when to
   ask"), so two dropdown entries collapsed onto one behavior under a label that promised otherwise.
   Rule: a mode the CLI cannot express emits **no flag** (never a substituted nearest match), and a
   mode it *can* express must actually emit it. Derive the UI copy from the mapping
   (`unsupportedModesNote`, `permissionModeAgentIds`) so a sentence cannot drift from the table.
   **The nearest match is most dangerous on the DEFAULT mode:** gemini has no value for `auto`, and
   `auto` is `DEFAULT_PERMISSION_MODE`, so translating it to `auto_edit` ("auto-approve edit tools")
   would have widened permissions for every existing gemini node at upgrade, with `modeSupported`
   answering `true` so the derived copy stayed silent. Check what an UNTOUCHED setting emits before
   you accept any mapping.
9. **A capability gate that is fed by a version probe belongs to the agent it probes.** Claude's
   `auto` gate is fed by `claude --version`; applying it to any other agent downgrades that agent's
   sessions on a machine whose *claude* is old or absent. `activePermissionMode` gates only
   `'claude'`, and every hint string names Claude for the same reason. An agent needing its own gate
   adds one beside claude's.

**Not writing the same rule twice**

10. **A duplicated rule drifts, and this branch was bitten three times.** The remote installer's hook
    event lists (it subscribed gemini to *claude's* event names, so remote gemini reported nothing at
    all), grok's raw-listener field decoding, and the two shells' session-name sweep gates (reverting
    both to `canRename` left the entire suite **green** while silently skipping every gemini node).
    The fix each time was **one definition in `src/core`** consumed by both shells — a default inside
    core beats an argument each shell passes correctly today.
11. **Both shells' raw hook listeners must stay in parity** (`src/main/index.ts`,
    `src/server/agent-status.ts`). If you add a branch to one, add it to the other or write down why
    not (the desktop's extra skip for remote SSH nodes is a legitimate asymmetry: the server has no
    SSH-project manager).
12. **Widen the transcript-path jail per ROOT, never to `$HOME`.** Hook POSTs can arrive over the
    remote reverse tunnel, and `isSafeLocalTranscriptPath` exists so a forged one cannot aim a read at
    `~/.ssh/id_rsa`. Add the narrowest directory that holds the transcripts (`~/.gemini/tmp`,
    `<codexHome>/sessions`) and honor the agent's own relocation env var — getting that wrong fails
    **closed** (the meter silently never fills), which is the quieter and therefore worse failure.
13. **Re-validate a hand-editable value at the interpolation site, not by its type.** Modes come from
    git-shared JSON and end up on a tmux `send-keys` line. A table lookup guarded only by
    `mode in table` accepted a forged `constructor` and returned a **Function** headed for that
    command line; `isPermissionMode` at the top of `approvalFlags` is what closes it. Same rule as
    `SAFE_SESSION_ID`. An unrecognized value must yield the **bare, safe** command.

**Degrading, and admitting what you did not measure**

14. **A guess must degrade to nothing, never to something wrong.** A title reader that cannot resolve
    returns `null` (the node keeps its own name); an unknown notification type is a no-op; a failed
    probe means the bare command, never a blocked launch. Say in the code which facts are *composed*
    rather than captured (gemini's resumed-transcript shape is) and what the wrong-guess cost is.
15. **Kill the "in place" actions carefully.** An exit sequence must be the CLI's documented primary
    and **bare**: gemini's `/quit` also takes `--delete`, which exits *and permanently deletes the
    session history* — the very conversation the restart exists to resume. It has its own test.
    Refuse the restart while the node is `working` **or** `blocked`: an exit line typed into a
    permission prompt **answers** it.
16. **Write the device checklist for what you could not run.** Every unverified claim becomes a
    numbered item; group the ones that fall out of a single capture run. `docs/grok-agent.md` §9 and
    `docs/gemini-agent.md` §9 are the format.
17. **Extend the base harness mapping, never a frontend allowlist.** Model support is
    `MODEL_SWITCH_CAPABLE` plus the protocol/env/flag leaf in `shared/agents/model-gateway.ts`.
    Frontends call `canSwitchModel` / `modelsForAgent`; they never spell Claude, Codex or a custom
    id themselves. This makes `baseAgent:'claude'` inherit discovery, filtering, environment and
    command grammar as one unit instead of four copies that drift.
18. **A model switch must refresh the shell environment without printing the key.** An already-live
    shell does not inherit a later `tmux set-environment`, and prefixing the resume line with
    `KEY=secret` leaks it into the pane/history. SIGTERM the pane's foreground non-shell process
    group (a typed `/exit` can land in the agent composer as prompt text), recycle the persistent
    session, and let cold restore resume with the new model under the newly injected environment.

## Session memory (the RAM pill + the per-session panel)

A bottom-left **RAM pill** (`components/SystemResourcePill.tsx`) beside the usage pill, and the
**session-memory panel** it opens (`components/SessionMemoryPanel.tsx`): used/total RAM of the
machine the **active project** runs on, and every `nt-*` tmux session on that machine sorted by the
memory its whole process TREE holds, each row travelable (`goToNode`) and killable. Scope is
`usageScopeKey` — the same helper the usage indicator uses, so the two pills can never disagree
about which machine they describe. Reading + parsing is `core/session-memory.ts` (this machine) and
`core/session-memory-remote.ts` (an SSH project's host), served over one RPC by
`core/session-memory-service.ts`, which BOTH shells boot. Full write-up + the device checklist:
**`docs/session-memory.md`**.

- **The memory is the agent CLI's own V8 heap — nodeterm does not allocate it, and it is not a
  leak.** Measured on the production host that prompted this (64 GB, 95 live `claude` processes): a
  `claude` process alone averages **335 MB** and peaked at **1159 MB**; 95 of them held **31.1 GB**;
  MCP children add 30–200 MB per session (playwright-mcp + Chrome ≈ 200 MB alone), so one "Claude
  terminal" tree is **440 MB – 1.2 GB**. `RssAnon` is essentially all of the RSS (1165 MB of 1187 MB
  on the largest process) and the repo sets no `NODE_OPTIONS`, so V8 sizes its heap off system RAM
  (`heap_size_limit` 4144 MB there). It is flat with process age — 0–24 h avg **340 MB** vs 7 day+
  avg **326 MB** — so each process takes a baseline and never returns it. **Write those numbers down
  rather than re-deriving them.** The user's number was right and their attribution was wrong; what
  the product was missing was not the allocation but the **blindness** — nothing told them 18
  sessions were live, that one was 1.2 GB, or that six belonged to a project they closed weeks ago.
- **The reaper is deliberately unchanged.** `core/session-budget.ts` reaps only **detached** sessions
  past a grace window, so on that host its kill list was **EMPTY** — 60 `nt-` sessions, 50 attached,
  0 eligible — while 31 GB sat there. An open canvas is attached, and attached is untouchable.
  Retargeting it is a separate change with separate risk; this feature adds **sight**, not policy.
- **`ok:false` is not `ok:true` with no rows** — the rule the whole feature exists to honour, and
  every layer preserves it. A sweep fails (no tmux, unreadable process table, **no socket answered**,
  a missing or out-of-order marker in the SSH reply, a rejected call) ⇒ `ok:false` and no rows; the
  panel then says "Could not measure sessions on this machine", and the grand total and the "*n*
  sessions" count are gated on a `measured` flag so a failure can never render as `0 B / 0 sessions`.
  "We looked and there is nothing" is its own sentence. A socket with **no tmux server** is an
  ANSWER, not a failure (`isNoServerError`), and that classifier is **anchored to tmux's own connect
  message**: `promisify(execFile)` folds stderr into `err.message`, and a bare `no such file or
  directory` also matches a tmux client missing a shared library (exit 127 on *every* socket) and a
  dead ssh ControlMaster — laundering either into "no sessions here" prints an empty panel over 20
  live ones. **The SSH leg applies the SAME classifier to the same rule**: each socket is fenced in
  the reply with its tmux exit status and its stderr (`##SOCK <name>` … `##SOCKRC <n>`, `2>&1`), and
  zero answers ⇒ `ok:false`. Its first form threw both away (`{ tmux …; tmux …; } || true`), so a
  host whose tmux client could not start emitted a stream byte-identical to an idle host's and the
  panel reported thirty live sessions as "No sessions are running here.". Do not "simplify" the
  fence back out — and do not replace the classifier with a blunt "any error ⇒ ok:false" either: on
  a host with no tmux server at all EVERY socket fails, and there "there are no sessions" is the
  honest answer.
- **`readMemInfo` has exactly one home** (`core/session-memory.ts`); `session-budget.ts` imports and
  re-exports it. The reaper's watermark and the pill must never disagree about how much RAM is free,
  and a second copy is exactly the drift this file warns about elsewhere. `null` = could not read,
  never zero.
- **The local reader reads `/proc/<pid>/status`, never `statm`.** `status` carries `PPid` and `VmRSS`
  in one file, already in kB; `statm` reports RSS in **pages**, forcing a page-size assumption — a
  hard-coded 4096 under-reports **4×** on a 16 KiB-page arm64 kernel and **16×** on the 64 KiB-page
  enterprise arm64 builds (40 MB printed for a 640 MB session). **Do not optimise this back to
  `statm`.** Non-Linux falls through to one `ps -eo pid,ppid,rss` call, through the same injectable
  seam as tmux.
- **`childCount` counts ALL descendants**, the agent CLI included: `pane_pid` is the pane's SHELL, so
  a claude session with two MCP servers reports **3**. The UI therefore says "**child processes**",
  never "MCP" — a plain `npm run dev` has children too.
- **The cadence split follows the cost.** A **local** scope polls the pill's number every 30 s
  (`HOST_POLL_MS`, one file read, free). An **SSH** scope is **never polled**: one read on scope
  entry, one when that project's ControlMaster comes up (an SSH project is opened before its master
  is ready, and with no timer behind it a first read against a dead master leaves the pill blank),
  and one per panel open / `⟳`. Same rule this file already sets for **Remote usage**, for the same
  reason: every remote read is an ssh exec plus a `ps` of somebody else's whole process table. The
  full sweep runs on the panel's MOUNT (it is unmounted while closed) and on `⟳` — never on a timer,
  never from the pill. One more consumer, same discipline: the welcome screen runs ONE **local**
  sweep per appearance (only while "Recently closed" is non-empty) for its per-project
  live-session badges (issue #442), bypassing the panel's store on purpose — it must not disturb
  `state/sessionMemory.ts`'s module-level scope stamp, and its scope is always THIS machine.
- **The pill is the single owner of the store's `startHostPoll` / `stopHostPoll`** — the timer and the
  active-scope stamp are MODULE SINGLETONS. The panel must never call them: a `stopHostPoll` on
  unmount would clear the pill's interval with nothing left to restart it, and the number would
  silently freeze until the next scope change.
- **A closed project is not an orphan.** `closeProject` keeps the project and its nodes on disk, so
  its sessions resolve to a real title and are labelled with their project; calling them orphans
  would invite the user to kill sessions they deliberately parked. `resolveSessionRows` is therefore
  fed EVERY project — filtering to the open tabs defeats the rule silently, from outside the file
  that states it. And **`orphan` is the distinguishing field, NOT `state === null`**: a plain
  terminal never enters the agent-status map, so deriving orphan-ness from a missing agent state
  would flag every one of them. Orphans are the point — they are what the reaper cannot see and no
  canvas can show.
- **On an SSH scope the kill routes over the ACTIVE project's master** (`lib/sessionKill.ts` →
  `sshProject.killSessions`), because `transport.destroy(nodeId)` reaches a remote session only
  through a LIVE local client carrying `sshRemote` — which an orphan has not, and neither has a node
  owned by a non-active project. Before this, every orphan row's `×` on an SSH project **promised a
  kill it could not perform**: the local socket was touched, the host's `nt-<id>` kept running, and
  the row came back on the next refresh unexplained. It is safe because it is a **round trip, not a
  lookup** — the row's `nodeId` is literally `session.slice('nt-')` from the sweep and `killSessions`
  maps it back through the same idempotent `sessionName()`, so the exact session name the sweep
  observed is killed on the host it observed it on (node ids are only per-launch unique, and nothing
  here rests on more). Ownership is re-resolved at click time, not taken from the row's stale
  `orphan` flag, so a node created since the sweep is not killed as an orphan.
- **The panel's second action is PAUSE, and it is the one that should usually be clicked.** The `×`
  was the only thing a row offered, which is the wrong tool for what the panel is mostly opened
  for. Measured on the reporting host (2026-09-04, 149 `nt-` sessions, 46 GB of tree RSS): the
  median session with a live `claude` holds **321 MB**, the median session whose CLI has already
  gone holds **5.6 MB** — so exiting the CLI returns **98.3%** of it, and killing the tmux session
  on top buys the remaining 1.7% at the price of the pane, its scrollback and the warm reattach.
  Population-wide the same split is 95% `claude`+`node` against 1.8% shell. **This is the number to
  quote when someone proposes making a memory lever destroy sessions**, and it is why issue #616's
  "end the tmux session too" was not built. The control is NOT a third depth: it calls
  `pauseAgentNode(id, false)` — the same "Pause session" the node menu offers, the same
  `performExitPhase`, the same PAUSED chip and the same Resume — because a panel-only "hibernate"
  would be a third concept for the user and a second exit path to keep in step with Eco's. Which
  rows may offer it is the pure `renderer/lib/sessionPause.ts`, and its two directions are
  deliberate: a row that could NEVER be paused (an orphan, a plain terminal, an agent we cannot
  quit-and-resume) renders **nothing** — a dead control on most rows of a machine-wide list is
  noise about something that was never possible — while a row that is merely refused right now
  (busy, no session id, or its terminal is not mounted on this canvas, which is the common case in
  a panel that spans every project) renders **disabled with the reason**. Canvas answers, because
  it is the only place that can see the node's agent, its registered pause closure and its
  `restartEligibility` at once; it asks on the same narrow `st?.sessionId` the node menu uses, so a
  row cannot promise what the closure would refuse.
- **The name and the host were never the hard part — the SOCKET was.** Two nodeterm tmux sockets
  live on one machine at once (`node-terminal` for a nodeterm running ON it, `nodeterm-rmt` for one
  SSH-ing INTO it) and the sweep lists **both**, while the kill targeted one — so every row off the
  other socket got "this stops its tmux session" and a kill that landed nowhere. Not exotic: a host
  running its own `nodeterm-server` while being SSH'd into is exactly that, and the local mirror
  (this machine's panel listing the `nodeterm-rmt` sessions another machine's nodeterm spawned here,
  all orphans locally) is the same shape. A kill that knows only a NAME therefore goes to **every
  socket that name could be on** (`KILL_TMUX_SOCKETS` → `remoteTmuxKillEverySocketArgs` /
  `localKillSockets`), which is safe because tmux's "can't find session" was already the ignored
  case, because the target is **exact** (`-t =nt-<id>`: without `=` tmux falls back to fnmatch then
  PREFIX matching on a miss, and `nt-…-1` is a prefix of `nt-…-12`, so a miss could kill a different
  session), and because the fan-out is **opt-in and asked for by exactly one caller**: it needs both
  "we do not know the socket" AND `everySocket` from the caller (`localKillSockets(live, everySocket)`,
  `sshProject.killSessions(…, {everySocket:true})`, `transport.destroy(id, {everySocket:true})` —
  the wire legs demand a literal `true`). A destroy for a session we HOLD still fires exactly one
  kill; and the unheld branch is not rare — an ordinary node-× on a node never mounted in this
  process takes it, which is the norm after an app restart — so project deletion and every ordinary
  × stay narrow rather than inheriting the panel's blast radius. The sweep and the reaper keep their own copies of
  the socket list **on purpose**: for them the ORDER decides first-wins de-duplication, for a kill
  it means nothing.
- **The generated SSH shell is tested under a real `/bin/sh`** (`session-memory-remote.test.ts`
  against a fake host tree, same discipline as `remote-claude-usage.test.ts` and
  `canvas-control-shim.test.ts`) — and it is not ceremony: the plan's own script said `echo ##MEM`,
  which prints an **EMPTY LINE** under POSIX sh (an unquoted `#` starts a word-initial comment) and
  would have made **every healthy host report `ok:false`**. The markers are quoted for that reason,
  every section header is printed unconditionally (a missing one means the stream was cut short, not
  that the host had nothing), and the socket names + `-F` format come from the shared constants so
  the two legs cannot look at different sockets.
- **Which machine answers** is decided in `session-memory-service.ts` by OR-ing two independent
  claims of remoteness — the renderer's `remote` flag and the shell's `isRemoteProject` — because a
  source that answers "no" while momentarily uninformed (index not loaded, master just dropped)
  would turn a remote query into a LOCAL sweep and publish this machine's sessions under the host's
  name. `sshScopePredicate` answers from **identity, not liveness** (`workspaceStore.sshProjectIds()`
  — a DISCONNECTED SSH project is still someone else's machine), OR-ed with the live masters. The
  `remote` option pair is deliberately asymmetric: `run` is optional, `isRemoteProject` is
  **required** — reading-without-knowing is a compile error.
- **Surfaces.** **Desktop**: full. **Server Edition**: the service runs and the ws-bridge has a REAL
  implementation, so the pill and panel describe the machine the server is served from; an SSH scope
  answers `ok:false` (no ControlMaster injected) and says so **by identity** via `sshScopePredicate`
  rather than trusting the renderer's flag — see docs/SERVER.md, including the silent dependency on
  the boot-time `workspaceStore.load()`. **Relay tabs**: the stub answers `ok:false` and the panel
  says session memory is not available there, which is a different story from a failure. **Kanban**:
  Canvas passes `overBoard={kanbanOpen}` (the same prop `UsageIndicator` takes), raising the pill to
  z 26 over the board's opaque 25, and an open panel to 60; with the board CLOSED the open panel
  still has to clear the sessions sidebar (z 12), which is the separate
  `.sysres-indicator:has(.sessmem-panel) { z-index: 13 }` — both `:has()` rules work only because
  the pill cluster is mounted OUTSIDE `<ReactFlow>`, whose wrapper's inline `z-index: 0` would trap
  any value inside it. **Mobile**: **N/A for v1** — *nodeterm
  mobile* attaches to tmux sessions over the transport protocol and has no per-session host-memory
  concept; adding one means extending that protocol (follow-up in the iOS repo).

**Offscreen release makes the macOS reaper bug far more visible, and the two shipped days apart.**
A node released while offscreen detaches its PTY client — so it becomes a DETACHED tmux session and
joins the reaper's candidate pool once past the 6 h grace. On a Mac reading `os.freemem()` the
watermark was permanently tripped, so those sessions were culled on the next sweep. More automatic
detaching + an always-true pressure signal is why the symptom read as "my sessions keep
disappearing" rather than as an occasional cull. The `vm_stat` reader is what makes the pool safe
again; the grace window was never the thing that was wrong.


## Node colors (one palette, two sections)

`src/shared/node-colors.ts` is the palette AND the control boundary — the picker's list and the
allowlist `color --color C` validates against are the same array, deliberately, so the two can
never disagree about what a legal colour is.

It has two sections. The seven macOS **system** colours are the list it always was. The **agent**
section is the brand colour of every builtin in `AGENT_CONFIG` plus `FALLBACK_AGENT_COLOR`, and it
exists because those colours were *already on the canvas*: `createAgentNode` paints a new node from
`AGENT_CONFIG` (the phone's `appendProjectNode` does the same), so a Claude node is born `#d97757`
— which the picker could not offer back once the user changed it, and which
`nodeterm color --color '#d97757'` refused with `node-color-invalid`, the app rejecting its own
colour. MEASURED against the live hook server before the change; both faces are one gap.

- **The agent section is DERIVED from `AGENT_CONFIG`, never re-typed.** Adding a builtin agent
  extends the palette by construction. `node-colors.test.ts` pins it three ways — every builtin's
  colour is in `NODE_COLORS`, every agent swatch's label is that agent's label, and `node-colors.ts`
  contains no agent hex as a literal on a non-comment line. A second copy of a colour table is the
  drift this file warns about everywhere else, and it has already happened once (see mobile below).
- **`SYSTEM_NODE_COLORS` is the subset for surfaces where the value is drawn as TEXT or as an
  opaque fill** — the app accent (`--accent` sits under hardcoded `#fff`), a project colour (the
  active tab's label is `color: p.color`) and a kanban column colour (`ColumnPill` draws the title
  in the raw hex at 10 px). It is also the **auto-assign rotation** for new frames, spawned teams
  and fresh columns: rotating a frame onto Claude's orange says "this frame is Claude's" and means
  nothing of the kind. The reason those surfaces differ is a measurement, not taste — on the dark
  theme white on gemini `#4285f4` is ~3.6:1 and on grok `#64748b` ~4.0:1, both under the 4.5:1 floor
  for the 10.5 px badge, and grok grey as tab text is ~2.6:1. Everywhere the colour is a dot, a
  border or a 6–20 % wash (node headers, sticky, files, group frames, the account default colour)
  offers the FULL palette.
- **`resolveNodeColor` runs BEFORE the allowlist, and only its output is ever persisted.** It takes
  a palette name (`blue`, `teal`, `claude`, `github copilot`) or the hex in any case, and yields a
  canonical value or `undefined`. Names are accepted because the refusal they earned was measured
  and expensive: seven opaque hexes taught nobody which one was teal, so a caller's next guess was
  another name and another refusal. The boundary is unchanged by this — a name can only ever
  resolve to a value the allowlist already held, and a name is never stored. The refusal now prints
  `name #hex` per swatch (`nodeColorChoices`), and the agent-facing skill text is generated from the
  same function per the canvas-control sync rule.
  `open-project --color` takes the same treatment against the **system** resolver; it used to reach
  `registerProject` with no validation at all.
- **One component draws every picker** (`components/NodeColorSwatches.tsx`), because the palette now
  has structure — headings and per-swatch names — and six copies of `NODE_COLORS.map(...)` are six
  places to forget the heading. `NodeColorSwatches.guard.test.ts` fails on a `.color-popover` this
  component does not own and on any renderer file that maps the palette into its own swatch row.
  The name is the feature: an agent brand colour is unidentifiable as a bare circle.
- **Mobile keeps its OWN list and is not updated here.** *nodeterm mobile* (`nodeterm-ios`,
  separate private repo) hand-copies the agent colours in `NewSession.swift`, stamped
  *"last verified 2026-07-17"*, to colour a session it creates; it has no node-colour picker at all,
  so the palette change reaches it as nothing to do. That mirror is the concrete precedent for why
  the desktop half is derived rather than typed — and it means a future brand-colour change owes an
  iOS follow-up (@eneskirca), not a desktop one.


## Semantic colours (one role per meaning)

Status and accent colours are TOKENS in `styles.css`, never hues at a call site. Two layers:
the Apple system palette `--sys-red … --sys-gray` (dark values in `:root`, light values in the light
block) and the ROLES that rules actually name — `--state-working | attention | unread | error |
success | warning | queued | automation` and `--git-modified | added | deleted | renamed |
conflict`. A role is a FILL value (glow, dot, stroke, and chip washes via
`color-mix(in srgb, var(--state-x) N%, transparent)`); text in a status hue keeps the text-safe
tokens `--danger --warn --caution --success --agent-working`, which the light theme darkens.

- **An appearance re-maps a MEANING by redefining a role**, not by restyling rules. The default look
  keeps its historical hues (working clay, unread = accent, attention red, warning orange); Liquid
  Glass maps them to the HIG semantics (see its section).
- **JS that needs a literal** (xterm find decorations, canvas-drawn sprites, the notch HUD, which does
  not load styles.css) reads `renderer/lib/palette.ts`; `styles.palette.test.ts` pins `--sys-*` to
  that table. JS that styles the DOM passes `'var(--role)'` strings (the minimap strokes, the git
  status letters, kanban priorities). Hex-with-alpha suffixes (`${c}2e`) do not work on a var —
  use `color-mix`.
- **Git status colours have ONE table**, `renderer/lib/gitStatusColors.ts`, used by Source Control
  and the history commit list; an unknown status draws in `--text`.
- **Minimap strokes are their own tokens, `--mm-working|attention|unread`.** The default look keeps
  its map language exactly (amber working, red needs-you, CLAY unread) on purpose: an uncoloured
  node's fallback stroke is the accent blue, so an accent "unread" would vanish into the map (the
  comment on `nodeStrokeColor` in Canvas.tsx). Under Liquid Glass the tokens map to the state roles,
  since node fills there are neutral ink and nothing can clash. The palette test pins both.
- **Left as-is on purpose:** agent brand colours (`AGENT_CONFIG`) on Claude-identity surfaces (the
  subagent node, the usage pill icon, the mascot), the node colour swatches (`node-colors.ts` is an
  allowlist — stored project colours must stay valid), node-kind default colours (persisted into
  project files at creation), kanban label chips (own palette), presence colours, the onboarding
  scenes, the notch HUD's own stylesheet.

## Node icons (emoji or picture)

A node may carry `data.icon` (`NodeIcon` in `@shared/node-icon`): `{type:'emoji', value}` or
`{type:'image', path}`. Absent = the node draws exactly as it did before the feature, which is the
degrade every failure path falls back to. Set from the node right-click menu ("Set icon…", hideable
like Colors — id `icon`), from the icon itself in the terminal node header, and from the kanban card
modal's header slot; drawn by the one `NodeIconView` on all four surfaces that list a node (canvas
header, kanban card, card modal, sessions sidebar row), because a session seen in four places must
not look like four sessions. **Terminal (session) nodes only in v1** — the menu row is gated on the
kind, deliberately: offering it on an editor or a group frame would persist a value nothing draws,
which is the "looks like it worked" failure this file warns about elsewhere. Extending it to sticky
or browser nodes means adding the draw and the set together, in one change.

- **`.nodeterm/project.json` is hostile input, so the icon is validated at BOTH serializer seams.**
  `normalizeNodeIcon` runs in `nodeStatesToFlow` (a cloned file becoming live state) *and* in
  `flowToNodeStates` (live state becoming the next reader's file — live node data is reachable by a
  peer canvas mutation, and whatever we write is what the next machine trusts). One-sided validation
  passes every round-trip test while leaving the other direction open; both seams are mutation-pinned
  in `workspace.test.ts`.
- **An emoji is ONE grapheme** (`Intl.Segmenter`, with a UTF-16 cap as the fallback, never as the
  primary rule — slicing units cuts a ZWJ sequence into a fragment). Uncapped, a shared file could
  put a 40 kB "emoji" into every header, card and sidebar row.
- **An image path must LOOK like an image** (extension → MIME). That gate is what stops a hand-edited
  project file from aiming `fs.readBinary` at `~/.ssh/id_rsa`. It is not a full jail — the path can
  still name any `*.png` on the machine, exactly as an editor node's `filePath` always could — but
  the bytes only ever become an `<img>` under a `'self'` CSP with no network, so the reachable
  outcome is "an icon fails to draw". A `./` path may not traverse (same rule as
  `isSafeQuickOpenRelPath`).
- **Two dialects in, one dialect out — and the traversal guard splits on BOTH separators, always.**
  The value is written by one machine and read by another, so `normalizeNodeIcon` ACCEPTS a Windows
  absolute (`C:\…`, `C:/…`) and a POSIX one wherever the check runs, while everything STORED is
  POSIX-separated. Both halves are load-bearing. Refuse `C:\…` on a mac and a mac user merely
  opening the shared canvas and saving it **silently strips a Windows teammate's icons** from
  `project.json` — such a path does not resolve on a mac, but not-drawing is a degrade and a degrade
  is not a reason to destroy the value on the way past. Store `.\a\b.png` and it means a file
  called `a\b.png` on POSIX and `b.png` inside `a` on Windows, so a relative path is canonicalized
  to `./` with forward slashes (the same way an emoji is canonicalized to its first grapheme).
  **`isSafeRelIconPath` splits on `[\\/]` on every platform**, because splitting on `/` alone made
  `./a\..\..\secret.png` ONE segment — neither `''`, `.` nor `..` — so it passed the guard
  everywhere and escaped the project root the moment a Windows reader resolved it; a segment may
  also not contain `:` (a drive qualifier, or an NTFS alternate data stream). **UNC is refused**,
  matching `renderer/terminal/file-links.ts`, which consumes UNC specifically so it can refuse it:
  reading one reaches another machine over SMB.
- **`localIconCwd` is the ONE definition of which cwd a `./` icon may resolve against**, asked by
  the picker's write side and by `useNodeIconSrc`'s read side. It was written twice and drifted: an
  SSH project's `cwd` is a path on the REMOTE host while the icon is read through the LOCAL `api.fs`
  (an SSH project runs on the local session — only a RELAY tab's api belongs to another machine), so
  the read side resolved a remote-rooted `./` path against this machine's filesystem and drew
  whatever happened to sit there. Undefined = the icon does not draw, which is the honest answer for
  a file on a filesystem this reader cannot see; absolute paths are unaffected, and absolute is what
  the write side stores for SSH.
- **A picked image is downscaled before it is written** (`lib/nodeIconThumbnail.ts`, 256 px long
  edge = 16× the drawn size). What lands in `.nodeterm/images/` is committed and cloned by everyone
  on the repo, and it draws at 13–16 px. SVG is passed through (rasterizing it would make it worse
  at every size, not merely smaller), as is anything already small in both dimensions and bytes (a
  canvas round-trip can make a hand-made 32 px PNG *bigger*) and any re-encode that came out larger.
  An animated GIF becomes a static PNG. The decision (`thumbnailPlan`) is pure so it tests under
  vitest's default `node` environment — jsdom has no canvas — and the browser half's decode/encode
  is injected. It **fails open in every direction**, including a decode that never settles
  (`DECODE_TIMEOUT_MS`): `chooseImage` awaits it before writing, so a hanging promise would leave
  the button stuck on "Copying…".
- **The extension is checked BEFORE the copy.** `dialog.selectFile` applies no filter, so an
  unsupported file is one click away — and validating after `saveCanvasImage` left an orphan file in
  the user's git-shared folder on every refusal, which nothing later removes.
- **The bytes are COPIED, not referenced.** The picker reads the chosen file and writes it through
  `files.saveCanvasImage` — the same seam canvas image nodes use — so it lands in the project's
  git-shared `.nodeterm/images/`. A path inside the project cwd is then stored `./`-relative
  (`portableIconPath`) and resolved on read (`resolveIconPath`), which is the convention
  `toPortableNodes` already set for node cwds. **This is the one place that convention is applied to
  a `filePath`-like field**: canvas image nodes still store theirs absolutely, so their file travels
  with the repo while the node naming it does not — an existing gap, not one this introduced.
  A cwd-less canvas, an SSH project (its cwd is on the host; the image is written app-locally) and
  the app-local fallback all keep an absolute path and simply do not travel. Not an error.
- **The picker owns Escape while it is the top dialog** (`useDialogStack()`'s answer, which was
  previously discarded). The gate is `isTop()` ALONE, matching `confirmKeyAction`, where `inDialog`
  guards Enter and never Escape: Enter is the affirmative key and must be aimed at the dialog, while
  requiring focus inside the box for Escape reproduces the original bug for a user whose focus sits
  on the body.
- **A relay tab is refused** (`canvasImportRefusal`, the same message and the same reason as canvas
  image import): the write is this machine's preload while the read is the peer's core, so the node
  would name a file only this machine has. Reads otherwise go through the PROJECT's session api, not
  `window.nodeTerminal` — which is what makes a peer-authored `./` icon resolve on the peer.
- Image reads are cached per `(projectId, absPath)` in `lib/nodeIconImage.ts`, because four surfaces
  mount independently and a thirty-card board would otherwise re-read the same bytes thirty times per
  open. Caching by path is safe: `saveCanvasImage` creates exclusively, so re-picking yields
  `logo (2).png` rather than overwriting.
- **Surfaces.** Desktop: full. **Server Edition**: full — every leg is already core (`fs.readBinary`,
  `files.saveCanvasImage`) or has a real browser implementation (`dialog.selectFile` → the web
  picker), so no new IPC was added and nothing is stubbed. **Mobile**: N/A for v1 — *nodeterm mobile*
  attaches to tmux sessions over the transport protocol and carries no per-node icon concept;
  surfacing one means extending that protocol (follow-up in the iOS repo).

## Desktop wallpaper + Liquid Glass (Settings → Appearance)

Two opt-in choices, both off by default so an update changes nothing on screen:
`settings.desktopWallpaper` (`none | {preset, id} | {image, path}`, read through
`normalizeWallpaper` in `@shared/wallpaper` — hand-editable, unknown ⇒ `none`) and the
**Liquid Glass appearance**, which is the fourth value of `settings.appTheme` (`'liquid-glass'`,
`isLiquidGlass` in `renderer/lib/appTheme.ts`) rather than a separate switch: it is a look, and its
light/dark base follows the terminal theme exactly like `auto`. Choosing it with no wallpaper picks
one (`defaultWallpaper`: the first macOS still, Sonoma Horizon when present, else a gradient) so
glass never sits over plain black; a wallpaper the user chose is never replaced. The pre-release
`glassTerminals: true` maps to it once in `settings-store` (only over `auto`).

- **The wallpaper is painted on `.canvas-root`** (`Canvas.tsx`), which spans the whole window —
  tab bar row included, so Liquid Glass's tab bar is glass over the picture — and is never
  transformed, so it stays put while the canvas pans and zooms. React Flow's own root goes
  transparent over it (`.react-flow.has-wallpaper`); the dot grid is faded to 30%, not removed,
  because snapping still aligns to it. **Settings → Appearance → Show grid dots**
  (`settings.canvasDots`, default ON in every appearance, read through `showCanvasDots` — only a
  literal `false` hides them) omits the React Flow `<Background>` entirely; it is display only, and
  snap-to-grid / align-to-grid keep using `gridSize`. Pure renderer + settings.json, so the Server
  Edition gets it unchanged. Under Liquid Glass the kanban overlay paints the SAME wallpaper
  (`useBoardWallpaperStyle`, `background-attachment: fixed` so it lines up with `.canvas-root`) and
  stays opaque to the canvas below — the covered-canvas animation gate stays valid; other looks keep
  the board's own background.
- **`background-image` + longhands, never a `background` shorthand next to `var(--canvas-bg)`.**
  MEASURED live: Chromium drops a var()-containing value once it passes ~2 MB, and a still's data:
  URL is ~3 MB, so the shorthand resolved to nothing and the canvas stayed black. The class rule
  supplies the colour underneath.
- **Images reach the page as data: URLs from core** (`core/wallpaper.ts`, `wallpaper:*` channels,
  registered by BOTH shells), so the CSP is untouched and no protocol was added. `load` never
  reads a renderer-named path: a macOS still is named by its `mac:` id and re-resolved against a fresh scan
  of `/System/Library/Desktop Pictures` (read at runtime, NEVER bundled — they are Apple's), and an
  imported image must be a hash-named DIRECT child of `<userData>/wallpapers/` (`cachedImagePath`,
  the whole jail). `import` is the exception — it copies any image-named regular file the caller
  names into that cache — which is no wider than the caller's own `fs:read`. Chromium cannot decode HEIC, so macOS converts with `/usr/bin/sips` to a JPEG
  ≤ 3840px — and `sips -Z` also UPSCALES (measured: 320px → 3840px), so it is passed only when the
  image is larger. An import is copied untouched unless it must be converted (HEIC, over 3840px or
  over the 25 MB load cap — re-encoding everything would flatten PNG/WebP alpha); off macOS, HEIC or
  an over-cap image is refused at import time, where the picker shows the reason.
- **The cache is pruned on a SAVED change and on import, never at boot.** `SettingsStore.init`
  answers an unreadable settings.json with the defaults, and pruning against that would delete the
  image the user chose. Only hash-named full-size files are candidates; thumbnails, temps and
  foreign files are never touched, nor is a conversion in flight. **The most recent imported image
  is kept too** (`settings.recentWallpaperImage`, written by `wallpaperChoice` when an image is chosen
  or left; `wallpapersToKeep` feeds the prune): choosing a preset once deleted it and the "Your image"
  tile vanished (visual QA H6). Core does not hot-reload in `electron-vite dev` — a prune change
  needs an app restart to take effect live. A failed renderer load is not
  cached (the file may appear).
- **Terminal nodes use their OWN theme's tint** (the chrome fill is for everything else). The node fill is the terminal theme's background at an alpha
  from `glassTintAlpha` (`renderer/lib/glassContrast.ts`): the smallest alpha at which the theme
  foreground keeps 4.5:1 over ANY backdrop. Checking white and black suffices because composite
  luminance is monotone in each backdrop channel — except when the text's luminance falls INSIDE
  that range, which `worstContrast` fails explicitly; a grey-backdrop sweep pins it per theme. The
  0.95 design ceiling yields to the guarantee: Solarized Dark gets 0.985, and Solarized Light — under
  4.5:1 even opaque — gets 1. The tint is per node (project theme override included) and the glass
  header takes the TERMINAL foreground for its text tokens, since it sits on the terminal's tint.
  **ANSI palette colours are NOT protected** (only the foreground is): protecting all 16 at
  min(3, own opaque contrast) forces alpha 1 on every built-in theme, because slots like `black` on
  a dark theme sit at ~1.3:1 and any translucency moves some backdrop onto them. Decided: keep the
  glass (foreground-only guarantee); the blur softens bright spots, and the Settings copy says
  coloured output can fade.
- **xterm paints no background under glass**: the theme background keeps its RGB at alpha 0
  (`glassTheme`, memoised per theme so `applyLiveOptions`' identity compare stays a no-op) plus
  `allowTransparency`, so the WebGL atlas is rasterised without a baked-in background. Both toggle
  LIVE through `applyLiveOptions` (the addon rebuilds its atlas on any option change); the card
  modal passes glass too (`useTerminalGlass`, shared with TerminalNode, sets the same
  `--term-glass-*` tint on `.kanban-modal__termwrap--glass`; its DOM renderer keeps app-painted cell
  backgrounds opaque); the settings preview never does. Glass stands down while a shared glyph grid is
  mounted (it paints text BELOW the nodes, so a tint would cover it), and, only when **Keep blur while
  moving** is off, the blur is dropped while the camera moves (`.canvas-moving`, toggled by
  `onMoveStart`/`onMoveEnd` via classList so a pan does not re-render Canvas) — the tint alone
  carries the contrast guarantee.
- **App-painted cell backgrounds become glass** (`terminal/glass-cell-backgrounds.ts`). addon-webgl
  0.18.0 paints every background rectangle at alpha 1 (`RectangleRenderer._updateRectangle`,
  `$a = 1`), so full-screen TUIs read as slabs: Grok's `48;2;20;20;20` screen fill, Codex's composer,
  Claude's bubble — and, worse, every DIM/ITALIC/hyperlink run on the DEFAULT bg, because those flags
  live in the bg word and the run gets a theme-background rectangle at alpha 1 (Codex's all-dim
  header box). No xterm option exists, so the private method is wrapped on the shared prototype
  (installed from `acquireWebgl`, original kept under a `Symbol.for` key so a hot reload never
  double-wraps; fail-open). `classifyRun`: inverse → stock opaque; attribute-only (default bg) → the
  theme bg's alpha (0 under glass); rendered bg ≠ the buffer cell's raw bg = a renderer override
  (selection, block cursor, search/decoration) → stock opaque; else an app PANEL → `glassPanelFill`.
  **A panel is a vibrancy LIFT or SINK of the glass, never the panel colour at the node's tint
  alpha** — that first version stacked a second tint on the node's own, and #3a3a3a over a bright
  wallpaper read as a dark smudge. Overlay alpha = `PANEL_K`(1) × OKLab distance(panel, theme bg),
  clamped [0.04, 0.22], dead zone < 0.02 (= draw nothing), INDEPENDENT of the slider (Claude's
  #3a3a3a on #1e1e1e → 0.11, Grok's #141414 → 0.044). Colour: the panel's own hue when OKLab chroma
  > 0.04, else white (lift) / black (sink). A move TOWARD the text (dark-theme lift, light-theme
  sink) at or right of the Readable tick uses the glass composite over the extreme backdrop
  (`B·t + white·(1−t)`) instead of pure white — the lift then never passes the glass's own worst
  case, so the theme fg keeps exactly the plain glass's 4.5:1; left of the tick it slides toward pure
  white by `(4.5 − glassWorst)/3.5`, continuous at the tick. Text check over the WHOLE run (the fg
  the renderer passes is only the first cell's): inverted-polarity text (dark text on a light bar,
  dark theme) must keep min(4.5, its opaque contrast) or the panel stays opaque; other text, while
  the guarantee is on, must fare no worse than on plain glass; glyphs under 3:1 on the opaque panel
  are decoration. **Polarity is judged against the PANEL, not the theme bg** (#303030 text is lighter
  than #1e1e1e yet dark on a #e4e4e4 bar — judged by the theme, that bar went translucent at 1.00:1).
  **One verdict per panel colour per terminal** (`panelVerdicts`): fill computed once, each text
  colour checked once, opaque sticks (a multi-row light box never stripes), reset on alpha or theme
  bg/fg change — addon-webgl rebuilds every row on any cell change, cursor blink included. Capped at
  `PANEL_VERDICTS_MAX` (4096) colours, cleared past it (truecolor images add thousands). A colour
  that turns opaque mid-pass re-runs `updateBackgrounds` once (also wrapped), so the rows already
  drawn in that pass do not stay translucent on an idle screen — `term.refresh` would not do it: the
  addon calls `updateBackgrounds` only when a model cell changed. The wrap
  body after the stock rectangle is try/caught per call (fail open per frame, not only at install). Reduce Transparency (t = 1) → opaque. Written premultiplied as `(c·√k, √k)` — the
  canvas is premultiplied and the addon blends alpha with SRC_ALPHA, so this stores exactly `(c·k, k)`.
  Only terminals registered through `setGlassCellAlpha` (TerminalNode, `glassOn` only) are touched —
  others are byte-identical; an alpha change calls `term.clearTextureAtlas()` because backgrounds
  only rebuild for changed cells — through `scheduleGlassCellAlpha`, which debounces a change between
  two glass alphas by 150 ms (a slider drag streams 0.01 steps and each rebuild wipes the SHARED glyph
  atlas); glass on/off is immediate. The test pins addon-webgl 0.18.0 and every private name, and
  sweeps both default themes to prove the Readable guarantee on panels. Ceilings: Increase Contrast
  does not strengthen panels (it pins the node to Tinted already); the DOM-renderer fallback keeps
  explicit backgrounds opaque (inline truecolor `background-color`).
- **Liquid Glass chrome** (`:root[data-nt-glass='on']`, set by App.tsx only for that appearance, so
  every other look is byte-identical). ONE chrome fill, `--glass-chrome-bg` = the resolved `--panel`
  at `glassChromeAlpha(--text, --panel, 4.5, highlights)` — **dark 0.74, light 0.745** on the shipped
  palettes. `highlights` (`glassChromeHighlights`) are the washes that stack on the SAME fill — the ink
  lift (`GLASS_LIFT_ALPHA` 0.14: hover rows, the active tab) and the accent selection
  (`GLASS_SELECT_MIX` 0.3) — each with the `--text-strong` ink styles.css gives highlighted states, so
  a highlighted row keeps 4.5:1 exactly like a plain one (plain fill alone: dark 0.70; the active tab
  then measured 3.9:1, visual QA round 2 N2). A new highlight wash on glass owes an entry there and
  `--text-strong` ink. The
  app's `--text` is itself TRANSLUCENT (`rgba(var(--tint-rgb), 0.85)`), so the ink moves with the
  backdrop and the white/black endpoint argument does not hold; the backdrop is SAMPLED (6×6×6 grid +
  grey ramp) and the test re-checks a fine sweep against the real tokens of both themes. App.tsx
  reads the tokens with the glass attribute removed first (harmless now that the tokens stay
  solid under glass; it keeps the solver independent of the gate). `--muted` has no guarantee
  (0.9 dark / 0.965 light would be needed). **Glass is OPT-IN per surface** (Slice D, visual QA
  round 3): the surface TOKENS (`--panel`, `--panel-header`, `--panel-2`, `--surface-*`,
  `--tabbar-bg`) keep their SOLID theme colours under glass, so any panel, menu, popover or tooltip
  that is not listed is opaque. They used to be redefined to the fill, and every unlisted floating
  surface became see-through with no blur — round 2 fixed five named ones and this file claimed
  "those five were the only traps"; round 3 found six more (Explorer and Source Control drawers,
  the context-menu flyout, the node and card-modal label pickers, the Members picker, tooltips).
  The translucent fill is handed out only by the two lists at the end of styles.css (plus the node
  kinds), each WITH a blur; a new glass surface goes in one of them. A piece INSIDE a glass surface
  that painted a token paints a lift, the input-well sink or nothing (find bar, markdown bar,
  session chips/fields, Settings sidebar, hover rows); small buttons keep their solid colour.
  **Never translucent without a working blur** (visual QA round 2 N1): an element with its own
  `backdrop-filter` (or filter, opacity < 1, mask, clip-path, blend mode) is a BACKDROP ROOT — a
  blur on anything inside it samples only the root's pixels, so a menu that pops out of it, or
  covers sharp content inside it, shows that content crisp through its tint. So: (a) a container
  that HOSTS pop-out menus keeps its glass on a `::before` layer (fill, hairline, blur) and is no
  backdrop root — `.dock`, `.dock-menu`, `.dock-menu__sub`, and every `.ctx-menu` that does not
  scroll (a scrolling menu cannot host a flyout, and a `::before` would scroll away with its rows);
  (b) a popover INSIDE a glass node or the card modal (`.ctx-popover`, `.color-popover`,
  `.label-picker`, `.kanban-meta__picker`; the host is its root) is simply not listed, so it is
  opaque — and all four paint ONE solid token, `--panel` (the colour the glass fill is `--panel` at
  an alpha of), with the glass hairline and one shadow (visual QA round 4 N4-M1: they were five
  greys); they keep the theme placeholder, not the glass one (N4-M2). Every MODAL dialog is glass
  (Remote access, Publish, consent, the GitHub issue modal and the mobile-launch card joined the
  text list); (c) in-flow pieces that only stack on their own blurred parent (node header, card-modal
  terminal) are fine. **Two guards.** `styles.glass-traps.test.ts` fails when a rule paints a glass
  fill (`--glass-chrome-bg`, `--glass-control-bg`, `--term-glass-bg`, `--term-glass-header-bg`) on
  a selector with no `backdrop-filter` in that rule or in a blur rule for the same element or its
  `::before` (in-flow exceptions are named with a reason), and when a surface token is redefined
  under the gate. It cannot see DOM nesting, so `scripts/glass-trap-probe.mjs` is the live half:
  run it against a dev build with remote debugging (`node scripts/glass-trap-probe.mjs --port
  9333`) with each overlay open; it lists every visible surface with background alpha < 0.9 whose
  blur is ineffective (none behind it, floating over a blurred/solid ancestor's content, or a blur
  escaping its backdrop root) and exits 1 on any. Slice D ran it over 27 states (dock menus,
  context menu + flyout, popovers, tab menu, palette, drawers, phone, help, Settings + theme menu,
  sessions, RAM, usage, label pickers, tooltips, kanban, card modal + pickers): 0 traps — at REST.
  **Glass never fades** (visual QA round 4, N4-H1): opacity < 1 makes an element a backdrop root, so
  a scrim fading its opacity turned the palette/dialog/drawer inside it into clear glass for the
  120–160 ms of every open, and a `::before`-hosted menu fading its own opacity did the same. Under
  glass scrims fade their `background-color`, glass surfaces enter by transform only (Remote access
  pops like its siblings), tooltips appear without motion and the focus-mode dock slides. The glass
  entrances sit in a no-preference query; under Reduce Motion the default-look `animation: none` list
  covers most surfaces, and a gated reduce rule covers the kanban card modal and its scrim (also the
  GitHub issue modal's), whose `kanban-fade`/`kanban-pop` opacity fades otherwise ran on glass (code
  review 7 #1). Both guards see motion: the static test fails on an opacity keyframe
  (`@-webkit-keyframes` too) or transition (a shorthand with no property name is `all`) on any glass
  surface, blurred `::before` layer, or scrim (the scrim list is the probe's exported `SCRIMS`)
  unless, in BOTH motion preferences, a rule overrides it — a gated rule, or a later default-look rule
  on the same selector; an override inside a media query counts only for the preference it names
  (the kanban modal passed because its only override sat in a no-preference query). A fade selector
  is matched when it can hit the same element as a surface (either covers the other, or they share a
  subject class). It reads the LAST backdrop-filter declaration, lets a later unconditional rule on
  the same element cancel a blur, counts `background-image` as a paint and matches coverage on the
  full selector (`:not()`/`:hover` kept). The probe runs a second pass that replays every finite
  animation, seeks every finite RUNNING animation to half its duration and scans (a blur inside a
  see-through backdrop root, or a blurred surface fading its own opacity, is a trap), inspects
  `::after`, gradient fills and mask-border roots. It never calls `pause()`/`play()` — on a CSS
  animation they install a play-state override, and an infinite animation then ignores the idle
  gate — since one synchronous evaluate cannot see the timeline advance, a seek freezes the frame and
  a seek back restores it; replayed elements get their `animation-name` re-set once more and lose a
  `style` attribute they did not have, and the pass verifies its own restoration. It exits 2 — never
  0 — when it checked nothing, the page does not answer within 20 s, or it left state behind. Slice E: 0 traps at rest and mid-animation, dark and light
  (palette, context menu, Explorer, Remote access, label picker, Settings, sessions). Node blur
  pauses during camera moves; chrome is static and keeps it. **Left opaque, deliberately:** Monaco, `<webview>` and `<video>` bodies (another
  renderer's surface), sticky notes (the colour is the note), and the `surface-sunken` wells
  (`bg-bg` inputs are a sink/lift of the page on glass). **Kanban**: header strip + columns are
  text-surface glass, cards a `--glass-lift-hover` lift WITHOUT their own blur, column/header dots
  neutral rings, status chips ink on a hue wash, drop target + reorder line neutral ink.
  **Two chrome fills (slider scope)**: `--glass-chrome-bg` for TEXT surfaces never drops below the
  readable alpha (and `--glass-text-blur` below the tick's blur); `--glass-control-bg` for the small
  floating CONTROLS (tab bar, dock, zoom, toolbar buttons, minimap, pills, sessions toggle) follows
  the slider down to `glassControlClearAlpha` — at least 0.35 and enough for 3:1 icons over every
  sampled backdrop after the control blur's `brightness(--glass-control-dim)`: dark 0.35, light 0.57
  (brightening cannot lift near-black water; round 2 H4) — and `--glass-control-blur` dims (dark, ×0.7) or
  brightens (light, ×1.3) their backdrop left of the tick — both from `glassChromeAlphas`. A new
  floating container goes in ONE of the two lists. **Highlights** are `--glass-lift(-hover)` (theme
  ink 14%/10%) or `--glass-select` (accent 30%) for THE selection, with `--text-strong` ink — never
  `--panel*`, a solid band on glass (visual QA H1/H2; round 2 N5: dock/zoom/sessions-row hovers and
  the default Button) — the hover lift carries `--text-strong` too (`--text` on it is 4.1:1). The
  readable alpha is solved for every accent swatch (Yellow needs 0.825 dark; bound 0.85). Segmented
  controls select with a neutral lifted thumb, so the one filled accent
  per view is the primary action (N12). `::placeholder` is `--glass-placeholder` (0.78 dark / 0.85
  light, 4.5:1 on the fill and never above `--text`, pinned by glassContrast.test.ts; the dark floor
  is 0.77); light has no room below `--text` at 4.5:1, so TYPED text in chrome fields is
  `--text-strong` and an empty field still reads empty (round 3 NM1). A placeholder ranks below
  secondary text (macOS: tertiary), so on dark glass the modal dialogs raise `--muted` to 0.82 (4.9:1
  worst case) and Remote access's hard-coded 0.55 lines take it (visual QA round 5, N5-M2); light
  cannot, and keeps the typed-text rule. The RAM panel's hard-coded 0.45–0.6 secondary lines take
  `--muted` (N5-L2). Destructive menu items (`.ctx-item.danger`) draw an
  ink label and keep red only on the icon; their hover is the ordinary lift (N5-M1: the red label was
  2.7–2.8:1 on dark glass). OK-range usage/context meters are
  neutral ink under glass (M1: green already means unread/success) — the fills are inline literals
  shared with the notch HUD, so the rule matches the serialised `rgb(48, 209, 88)`. Under glass `--muted` is 0.7 dark / 0.8 light and `--muted-2` = `--muted`. The minimap draws node rectangles in translucent theme ink
  (inline node colours overridden with `!important`), keeping the working/attention/unread strokes.
- **No window accents under Liquid Glass.** A terminal window's per-node colour arrives as INLINE
  styles (`borderTopColor`, the colour dot's background), so the overrides carry `!important`: a
  neutral `--glass-edge` border, the dot as a neutral ring (it is still the colour-picker button),
  neutral resize handles. State survives without the colour: selection is an ink (`--text`) outline,
  unread keeps its `--state-unread` border + glow, working/attention keep their `::after` glows and
  header badges. The sessions list and the kanban board keep node colours. `styles.liquid-glass.test.ts`
  pins the gate and every neutralising override.
- **Glass palette** (HIG color.md › Liquid Glass color). The block at the end of styles.css
  redefines only ROLES (see **Semantic colours**): working = the accent (no longer Claude clay),
  needs-you = orange, finished-unseen = green, warning = yellow, error = red — one hue per meaning,
  and orange means only "needs you" (`--warn` becomes `--caution`, the text-safe yellow). The glows,
  minimap strokes, sidebar signals and badges follow with no rule of their own. Status labels on a
  glass header are ink over a tinted chip (`-webkit-text-fill-color: var(--text)` with the chip
  mixed from `currentColor`), not coloured text. `styles.palette.test.ts` pins the mapping and that
  no two meanings resolve to the same colour, in both themes.
- **Glass slider + refraction** (Settings → Appearance, shown only under Liquid Glass; iOS 26's
  Clear ↔ Tinted). `settings.glassTint` is a slider POSITION, not an alpha (`null` = the Readable
  tick, read through `resolveGlassSlider`): every surface has its own readable alpha, so each maps
  the position through three points — `GLASS_CLEAR_ALPHA` 0.2 at Clear (terminal nodes; chrome controls 0.35, text surfaces never below readable — see Liquid Glass chrome), its OWN computed readable
  alpha at `GLASS_READABLE_TICK` (0.7), `max(readable, 0.95)` at Tinted (`glassSliderAlpha`). At the
  tick every surface is exactly at the alpha `glassTintAlpha`/`glassChromeAlpha` computed, and every
  alpha right of it is higher — so Readable→Tinted keeps 4.5:1; left of the tick the row says the
  guarantee is off. Measured: chrome dark 0.20 / 0.70 / 0.95, chrome light 0.20 / 0.745 / 0.95,
  nodeterm-dark 0.20 / 0.675 / 0.95 (Clear / Readable / Tinted). App.tsx sets `--glass-t` (blur
  16→28px on chrome and × 0.85 = 13.6→23.8px on terminal nodes via `--glass-term-blur`; saturation
  `--glass-sat` 180% at Clear → 150% from the Readable tick to Tinted, text surfaces a flat 150% —
  round 2 N9: 1.6–2.0 turned glass olive or pink over bright wallpapers). **Refraction** is ONE shared SVG filter
  (`components/GlassRefraction.tsx`, `#nt-refract`: a 256² edge-lens displacement map generated once,
  `primitiveUnits="objectBoundingBox"` so one filter fits every element), referenced from
  `--glass-blur` as `url(#nt-refract)` — no per-node filters. **It runs LAST in the chain**
  (`blur() saturate() url()`) and composites over its SourceGraphic so its output is opaque: first in
  the chain (plus an in-filter soft blur with default edgeMode) it let Chromium show a 20–40px band of
  SHARP backdrop inside every glass rim at every slider value (visual QA C1). Measured on an empty
  `.ctx-menu` over terminal text, rim-band high-frequency energy 2.55 → 0.20 (Clear), 1.90 → 0.07
  (Readable) = the interior's. **Terminal glass flattens luminance**: `--glass-term-blur` adds
  `contrast(calc(1 - var(--glass-t)))` (1 at Clear, 0.3 at Readable, 0 at Tinted) — a blurred photo
  under a big pane read as smudges; empty glass at Readable over the lake photo went 2.2:1 → 1.28:1
  brightness swing. It keeps the backdrop a backdrop colour, so the guarantee is untouched. The status
  chip wash is sized at the Readable tick for every slider position (the wash only grows with alpha).
  App.tsx sets `data-theme`, `data-nt-glass` and the glass custom properties in LAYOUT effects, so no
  frame paints the attribute without its fill. Its scale is `0.025 × (1 − t)`; it moves
  backdrop pixels, never the tint, so it cannot touch contrast. Glass NODES carry a 1px rim light instead of a sheen: a
  masked-ring `::before` (anchored to the React Flow wrapper), brightest top-left; a surface-wide
  diagonal sheen was tried and washed the pane out. Refraction scale max is 0.025 (was 0.06). Node blur+refraction pause while the camera moves
  (`.canvas-moving`) ONLY when **Keep blur while moving** is off (`settings.glassBlurWhileMoving`,
  default ON, read through `keepGlassBlurWhileMoving` — only a literal `false` pauses): on, Canvas
  never adds the class, so the glass stays live through a pan at a GPU cost; chrome keeps both always. MEASURED on the live dev build (CDP computed style):
  Chromium keeps `url("#nt-refract") blur(…) saturate(…)` on the tab bar, dock, sessions sidebar,
  minimap, zoom controls and terminal nodes.
- **Needs-you on glass is an INNER light** (the user's pick, "variant B"): the outer red `::after`
  halo is hidden and a `::before` on the React Flow wrapper paints an inset rim light in
  `--state-attention` (orange) that breathes 0.35 → 1 over 2.4 s — `pointer-events: none`, above the
  glass body (z 5), and fading out ~36px inside the rim so terminal text stays readable. It reads
  `--nt-anim-state` (the covered-canvas pause), holds static-lit when the window is idle and static
  at 0.7 under Reduce Motion. The default look keeps its outer glow.
- **Accessibility outranks the slider** (HIG liquid-glass.md, like iOS). `lib/useGlassA11y.ts`
  reads `prefers-reduced-transparency` and `prefers-contrast: more` (one subscription, Electron and
  browser alike) and `glassSurfaceAlpha` applies them to every tint alpha: **Reduce Transparency**
  = alpha 1, no blur, no refraction filter in the DOM, no rim light, and the slider row is disabled
  with the reason; **Increase Contrast** = the slider pins to Tinted, `--glass-edge` goes to 0.5,
  terminal borders thicken and the `--sys-*` palette takes HIG's increased-contrast columns
  (`SYSTEM_COLORS.darkContrast|lightContrast`, pinned to the CSS). The alpha half lives in JS
  because the fills are INLINE custom properties a media query cannot override. **Reduce Motion**
  holds the three state glows static-lit (the idle gate's values) and stops the minimap and badge
  pulses, in every appearance — the state still reads, nothing breathes.
- **Agent TUIs after a live switch to a light terminal theme** keep the dark palette they latched at
  launch. A/B, nodeterm Light, Readable glass vs opaque Light, same frames: Codex composer 1.25:1 vs
  dark-on-black (unreadable both), Codex model line 1.6 vs 1.41, Claude dim status 1.96 vs 2.86, Grok
  identical — the apps' colours, not the glass (app colours are outside the guarantee). Left as is;
  restart agents after a theme switch.
- **Surfaces.** Desktop: full. Server Edition: gradients + glass; the stills list is empty (not
  macOS) and "Choose image…" is hidden (a picker there browses the SERVER's disk). Relay tabs keep
  a stub (no stills, import refused). Mobile: N/A (no canvas). Kanban: the board paints the wallpaper under Liquid Glass (see Liquid Glass chrome).

## Keybindings (registry, overrides, dispatch)

Every user-facing chord is a registry command, and the whole engine is **one module**:
`src/shared/keybindings.ts` holds the command registry, per-command validation
(`normalizeBindingForCommand`), effective-binding resolution, conflict detection, override
sanitization and the pure event→command resolver. **Do not split it** — main, the renderer and the
Server Edition bridge all import it, and a second copy of any of those five is how the dispatcher,
the Settings section and ShortcutsPanel start disagreeing about what a chord means.

- **Overrides live in `settings.keybindings`** (hand-editable JSON): an absent id = the registry
  default, `[]` = **disabled**, a list = exactly those chords. It is **sanitized at READ**
  (`sanitizeKeybindingOverrides` → `renderer/lib/keybindingOverrides.ts`, memoized on the raw
  object's identity), which is what makes a hand-edited file safe; the Settings section refuses a
  bad candidate BEFORE saving (`commitCandidate`) so the user learns which chord was refused
  instead of watching it vanish on the next launch. The write path is raw and the gates read the
  sanitized map, so a dropped hand-edit is invisible in the UI but still on disk until a UI write
  or Reset replaces the map.
- **Dispatch has exactly two owners per shell.** The renderer's is ONE window `keydown` listener
  in `Canvas.tsx`, on the **bubble** phase — the Settings recorder's `stopPropagation` on an armed
  capture depends on that, and moving it to capture would let a recorded chord fire the command it
  is being bound to. On the desktop the other is `src/main/keydown-intercept.ts`, a **closed
  allowlist** of chords it must steal back from the application menu before the page ever sees
  them. The **Server Edition** has no main process, so for `node.toggleMarkdown` ONLY the bridge's
  `renderer/bridge/markdown-toggle-key.ts` stands in for that intercept — still one owner per
  shell, never both — and it runs on the bubble phase for the same recorder reason. **The Canvas
  dispatcher must never gain a `node.toggleMarkdown` handler**: in the browser it would toggle
  every hovered node twice, and on the desktop it would duplicate main's forward. (`node.close`
  has no browser owner at all: the browser keeps ⌘W.)
- **Invariants**
  - **Never read `settings.speech.shortcut`.** The dictation chord is `dictationBinding()` (the
    first effective `speech.dictation` binding); the legacy field is a **downgrade mirror only**,
    written by `setKeybindingOverride` so an older build still finds the user's chord.
  - **`isHoldChord('')` is TRUE** (an all-false parse has a null key), and `''` is what a DISABLED
    dictation binding reads as — so every caller owes an explicit `=== ''` check first. Without it
    a disabled binding arms a modifier-less hold chord that fires on any keydown.
  - **`MAIN_INTERCEPTED_COMMAND_IDS` must mirror the registry-backed commands `keydown-intercept.ts`
    actually resolves** (`keydown-intercept.test.ts` pins it). The Settings UI's app-wide shadow
    warning reads that list and cannot derive it — main is not importable from the renderer. Note
    what the pin cannot cover: a HARDCODED intercept (the `Digit0` branch) has no command id, so it
    swallows its chord app-wide with the recorder reporting no conflict.
  - **Dictation has its own conflict bucket** (`conflictBucket` — `speech.dictation` is never in
    `global`), because it never competes at dispatch: the resolver skips it and its own keyed
    listener claims the chord FIRST **in plain app focus only**, which is precedence, not ambiguity.
    Overlap policy is deliberately asymmetric — the LOAD path PERMITS a shared chord (legacy
    settings.json files contain them and `sanitizeKeybindingOverrides` would otherwise strip the
    user's own binding with the migrated one), while the Settings UI REFUSES to create one
    (`commitCandidate`'s two dictation gates, both keyed-only — a modifier-only hold chord renders
    as `…:(hold)` and can never match a keyed identity).
  - **The terminal-first stand-down is `policyStandsDown(policy, terminalFocused)`, and both halves
    are refusals.** `settings.terminalShortcutPolicy` (`app-first` default, Settings → Keyboard
    Shortcuts, read everywhere through `normalizeTerminalShortcutPolicy` because it is
    hand-editable) never stands anything down under `app-first`, whatever the mirror reports — that
    is the byte-identical guarantee for a user who never touched it. Under `terminal-first` with a
    focused terminal, main stops claiming its chords AND disables the command-style menu items in
    `menuItemIdsToSuspend` — Minimize, Toggle Kanban Board (⌘⇧B) and Settings (⌘,) everywhere, plus
    Close off-mac, with **Reload deliberately excluded** (see **Window chrome**): not calling
    `preventDefault` alone would hand ⌘M straight to `{role:'minimize'}`, which is strictly worse
    than having no policy. **The MENU's state is the composed
    `menuStandsDown(shortcutRecording, policy, terminalFocused)`** — an armed shortcut recorder
    suspends the same items, so ⌘M / ⌘⇧B / ⌘, / off-mac Ctrl+W reach the recorder instead of the
    menu item that owns them; `menuStandsDown(false, …)` is `policyStandsDown(…)` by construction.
    The two INTERCEPT thunks stay independent parameters — only the menu ORs them.
    **The CLOSE leg has one extra, policy-independent stand-down** (issue #383, off-mac only):
    `closeStandsDownInTerminal(isMac, terminalFocused)` — off-mac `node.close`'s default chord is
    Ctrl+W, readline's kill-word, so while a terminal has focus the close intercept lets the chord
    fall through UNTOUCHED and `syncMenuForStandDown` disables the Close menu item on top of the
    shared list. mac's ⌘W is deliberately unaffected (not a shell key), and ⌘/Ctrl+M and ⌘/Ctrl+0
    keep firing — this is one chord whose terminal meaning outranks its app meaning, not a policy
    change. Falling through main is not enough: xterm's custom key handler runs before the Canvas
    dispatcher, whose main-intercepted command cases deliberately have no renderer handlers.
    `terminalChordBubbles` must therefore refuse every `MAIN_INTERCEPTED_COMMAND_IDS` command; if
    it returned true for `node.close`, xterm would withhold `^W` while the unclaimed event bubbled
    to Canvas. **`node.toggleMarkdown` is the one exception and BUBBLES**: in the Server Edition its
    owner is a WINDOW keydown listener in the bridge (`bridge/markdown-toggle-key.ts`, below), which
    xterm would otherwise starve by writing `\r` and cancelling the event. It changes nothing on the
    desktop — under app-first main claims the chord above the page, under terminal-first the
    resolver already refuses it, and main has no terminal-focus stand-down for it. One predicate,
    two main-process consumers are pinned in `keydown-intercept.test.ts`
    (including a source-level wiring pin, since the menu leg lives against a real Menu in index.ts),
    and `keybindingOverrides.test.ts` pins the renderer-to-xterm hand-off through
    `terminalKeyAction`.
  - **The Server Edition's ⌘/Ctrl+M is the bridge's own window listener**
    (`renderer/bridge/markdown-toggle-key.ts`, wired as `onMarkdownToggle` in `bridge/stubs.ts`):
    a browser has no `before-input-event`, so the stub used to be `noopUnsub` and the chord did
    nothing there. It mirrors the intercept — effective `node.toggleMarkdown` bindings read per
    keystroke, `policyStandsDown` (now in `shared/keybindings.ts`, re-exported by
    `keydown-intercept.ts`, so both shells run ONE predicate) with focus read from the DOM via
    `isTerminalTarget` — plus a `defaultPrevented` event is left alone. **A held-key auto-repeat
    is claimed but never re-toggles, in BOTH shells**: the browser listener preventDefaults it and
    forwards nothing, and `keydownIntercept` answers `{action: null}` for a repeated toggle-markdown
    chord (still swallowed, so the repeat cannot fall through to the menu's Minimize) — the same
    shape as the held ⌘0. Bubble phase for the recorder's sake, installed only
    while subscribed. It cannot double-fire on desktop (only `buildStubApi` reaches it; the relay
    tab takes `onMarkdownToggle` from the local preload). macOS Chrome reserves ⌘M for minimize,
    so the default chord only reaches a Mac browser tab after a remap (docs/SERVER.md).
  - **ShortcutsPanel is DERIVED from the registry, never a hand-written list.**
    `buildShortcutSections` iterates `COMMAND_DEFINITIONS` — one section per `CommandGroup` in
    registry source order, the label from `def.title`, and EVERY one of the command's EFFECTIVE
    chords — and a command with no effective binding (ships unbound, or the user disabled it) is
    OMITTED rather than shown chord-less. All chords, not just the first: off-mac
    `terminal.copySelection` holds Ctrl+Shift+C AND Ctrl+Insert, and in the **Server Edition**
    Chromium reserves Ctrl+Shift+C for the inspector un-preventably — so a first-chord-only row
    advertised the one that cannot work there. The panel it replaced enumerated 24 ids by hand against a
    45-command registry, so ⌘⇧T (reopen last closed), ⌘⇧↵ (maximize node), the ⌃⌥arrow zone snaps
    and Copy terminal selection were live chords it never mentioned, and no ships-unbound command
    could ever appear even after the user assigned one. `ShortcutsPanel.test.tsx` is the watchdog:
    it binds every registry command and asserts a row per `def.title`, so a new command that fails
    to surface reds it. Same stale-doc rule as the canvas-control skill body (#269) — derive the
    text, don't retype it.
    Rows the registry does NOT own (mouse gestures, the two `zoomShortcut.ts` chords, the ⌘1-9
    project jump, tmux/xterm terminal behaviors) are literal, and still read from settings where
    the behavior does: the hover dwell prints `panHoverDelay` and the drag rows follow
    `canvasDragMode`, because the old fixed text claimed 0.6 s and a right-drag pan React Flow
    (`panOnDrag={[1]}`, middle button only) has never done.
    **One honest exception to "the chord shown is the chord that fires":** `terminal.copySelection`
    is a registry row whose matcher is still the hardcoded `isCopyShortcut`
    (`terminalKeyAction` keeps the copy chords and Shift+Enter "whatever the registry says"). Its
    registry defaults match that matcher on both platforms, so the row is accurate as shipped; a
    REMAP of it would not be, on this panel or in Settings. Wiring `isCopyShortcut` to the registry
    is the fix.
  - **`terminalFocused` is a MIRROR, and its fail-safe direction is `false` = not focused =
    intercepts ON.** `renderer/lib/terminalFocusMirror.ts` reports focus changes to main and is
    change-deduped (it never re-asserts), so a page that died mid-report, a reload, or a window that
    never had one all resolve to intercepts on — never to "off with nothing alive to turn them back
    on". Consequence: clear the bit ONLY where the renderer's DOCUMENT is ending (window `closed`,
    `render-process-gone`, main-frame navigation). Clearing it under a live page that is still
    focused on its terminal strands mirror and main out of sync with no event that can reconcile
    them, and the policy is dead until the user clicks away and back.

## Canvas interaction & panels (`Canvas.tsx` is the hub)

- **Context menus** (`components/ContextMenu.tsx`, portal, icons from `components/icons.tsx`):
  pane right-click = add nodes at cursor (terminal / Claude / sticky / open file) + select
  all + fit + **Tidy canvas** (`arrangeAllNodes` — packs every top-level node, including group
  frames as rigid units, into a non-overlapping grid via `arrangeNodes`, sorted by current
  (y, x) so the pack roughly preserves reading order; mirrored in ⌘K as "Tidy canvas" and in the
  keybinding registry as `canvas.tidy` (default ⌘/Ctrl+Shift+A, remappable); both
  hidden below 2 top-level nodes, where it could only be a visual no-op that still writes
  `project.json`) + restart-idle-agents (the bulk in-place agent restart, mirrored in ⌘K; both
  hidden when the canvas holds no restartable agent node, where they could only report "0
  restarted");
  node/selection right-click = group, color, duplicate, align-to-grid, collapse,
  markdown-view (terminals), refresh-terminal (terminals — bumps `respawnNonce`: fresh PTY attach
  to the SAME tmux session; manual recovery for a stuck/unpainted terminal, and the same action
  sits in the node header as `term-node__refresh` since a dead view is a bad place to hunt for a
  right-click; nothing running is interrupted), restart-agent
  (single agent node — the in-place CLI restart above; absent for a CLI we cannot quit + resume,
  disabled with a hint while the session is busy or has no id yet), delete. Actions live
  in `Canvas.tsx`, operate on `targetIds`. **Conversation actions are grouped** so an agent node's
  menu fits on screen: **Transfer conversation ▸** holds one row per target (a model-capable target
  nests its gateway models one level further), and **Restart ▸** holds the restart variants —
  restart, restart + fresh shell, restart on subscription, then Reopen as. Switch model ▸ and Switch
  account ▸ stay first-level rows beside it (everyday choices, not recovery restarts).
  `ContextMenu` renders submenus to any depth (`MenuRows` is recursive); a flyout that hosts a
  submenu drops its scroll (`.ctx-submenu--host` — `overflow: auto` would clip the
  nested flyout) and `useSubmenuFlip` lifts a flyout that would run off the bottom. The non-destructive rows are user-hideable from
  **Settings → Appearance** ("Node menu items" / "Terminal header buttons"), stored as HIDDEN
  lists in `settings.hiddenNodeMenuItems` / `settings.hiddenHeaderButtons` (empty = everything
  shows). `lib/ui-visibility.ts` owns the two inventories and `isHidden`, which only answers for
  ids it knows — so Delete, restart-agent, branch/transfer, terminal Search and Close can never
  be hidden, whatever settings.json says. The group-frame menu's colors strip answers to the same
  `colors` id; builders run through `tidySeparators` so a hidden row leaves no dangling rule.
- **Add menu** = bottom dock (`Dock.tsx`) `+`, mirrored by the pane menu and command palette.
  `lib/addMenuSpec` is the one source for WHICH kinds are addable, and since 2026-09 also for how
  the two `ContextMenu` surfaces GROUP them: `New terminal` · `New remote…` · the account-capable
  agents · `New agent ▸` · `New view ▸` · `Files ▸` · `Orchestrate ▸`, then the canvas actions. It
  replaced a flat 18-row list, on the rationale that ⌘K already makes every one of these
  searchable and the keybinding registry already carries a remappable command per agent and per
  node kind (`node.new*`) — so this menu does not have to be EXHAUSTIVE, it has to be FAST.
  Four rules hold it together, and the first is the one that is easy to get wrong:
  - **The submenu depth cap is STRUCTURAL.** `ContextMenu` renders a submenu's children with
    `if (child.type === 'colors' || child.type === 'submenu') return null` — a third level is
    dropped with no error and nothing on screen. Claude's and Codex's **account pickers are already
    level-two submenus**, so nesting either row behind `New agent ▸` would silently delete the
    account picker for exactly the users who have managed accounts. MEASURED, not assumed, in
    `components/ContextMenu.submenu-depth.test.tsx`; teach the component a third level and that
    test goes red so the pin can be reconsidered deliberately.
  - **Which agent rows stay at the first level is DERIVED, never a spelled-out agent id**
    (`isPinnedAgentEntry`): a row that IS a submenu (structural, per above) **or** whose agent is in
    `ACCOUNT_CAPABLE_AGENT_IDS` (`shared/agents/account-binding.ts` — the same list `boundAccountId`
    reads, so a third agent gaining managed accounts cannot light up one and not the other). The
    second half exists because rule one alone would move Codex in and out of the submenu as the
    user adds or removes accounts, and a menu that rearranges itself is a menu nobody can learn.
    A new builtin agent joins `New agent ▸` by itself; one that gains accounts is promoted by itself.
  - **`ADD_ITEM_GROUP` is a total `Record` over the kind union on purpose** — a new `AddItem` kind
    is a compile error until somebody routes it, instead of silently landing in one bucket forever.
    `remote` stays top-level because it is not an agent: burying the one SSH-session entry point
    under a menu named "New agent" puts it where nobody would look.
  - **Grouping is a rearrangement, never a filter, and a nested row keeps its REASON.** The rows
    still come from `contentAddItemsToMenuItems`, so `New worktree…` is greyed with
    `WORKTREE_SSH_HINT` inside `Orchestrate ▸` exactly as it was at the top level (the cap drops
    nested submenus, never a leaf's `disabled`/`hint`). Tests pin that nothing becomes unreachable.
  **Per surface**: the pane right-click and the sessions-sidebar project-header "+" share the
  grouped tree (`buildGroupedAddMenu`); the **group-frame** menu shares the agent half
  (`agentEntriesToMenuItems`) and keeps its own three content rows; the **Dock stays FLAT** (its
  popup is opened deliberately, it already omits terminal + remote, and its agent flyouts are
  bespoke JSX — grouping it means a second submenu implementation for crowding nobody reported);
  the **kanban column "+ New session" is NOT a consumer of the spec and never was** — its
  `KanbanCreateChoice` is a closed union of the kinds that become a CARD, so feeding it this list
  would offer kinds the board can never show. `addMenuSpec.surfaces.test.ts` pins all four.
  None of the add rows are in `ui-visibility`'s hide inventory (it covers the NODE menu and the
  terminal header), so grouping does not interact with hiding today; a future hideable add row
  would need the group's own row to disappear when it empties, which `buildGroupedAddMenu` already
  does — it emits no submenu for an empty bucket.
- **Edges** are all one React Flow type, `floating` (`canvas/FloatingEdge.tsx` over the pure
  `lib/floatingEdge.ts`): every family — ropes, context bridges, note links, subagent/loop card
  edges, trigger edges — is drawn between the midpoints of the two nodes' facing sides instead of
  fixed handle sides, so an edge to a node placed left of or above its source takes the short way
  round rather than looping across the canvas, and every edge using a side meets the node at ONE
  point (2026-09-03: enes's first try showed a hub with entries fanned along its whole top edge).
  Context and note links are the exception in one respect: they anchor only on the left/right
  sides (`data.anchor: 'horizontal'`), where the `link-out`/`link-in` drag handles are drawn. A terminal node's **eye** (`hide-fanout`, "Hide cards &
  connections") hides its subagent/loop cards AND every edge touching that node — display only:
  the links still authorise reads and an `--after` still waits. See the `--after` bullet under
  Canvas control for the rope model the eye hides.
  **Surfaces:** Desktop + Server Edition are identical (pure renderer + React Flow internals — no
  new IPC or bridge member); the kanban board is N/A (it shows cards, never edges); mobile is N/A
  (the transport protocol carries no edges).
- **Undo/redo**: debounced snapshot of the nodes array on settle (drag/edit), `pastRef`/
  `futureRef` stacks, ⌘Z / ⌘⇧Z + dock buttons. History resets per project load; skipped
  while typing in inputs/terminals.
- **Selection/pan**: box-select on left-drag (`SelectionMode.Partial` — touch to select);
  pan = middle-drag or trackpad two-finger (`panOnScroll`, `zoomOnScroll:false`); pinch
  zoom. Right mouse is free for the context menu.
- **Delete** (Delete/Backspace) opens `ConfirmDialog` before removing selected nodes.
- **Zoom chords** (`renderer/lib/zoomShortcut.ts`): **⌘/Ctrl+0 → `zoomTo100`** (actual size — what
  the browser AND Electron's default View menu already mean by that key) and **Shift+1 → `fitAll`**
  (the Figma/tldraw/Excalidraw "zoom to fit"). Matched on `e.code`, like the project-jump chord,
  which excludes `Digit0` so the two can never collide. The module is a PURE decision because both
  chords move the camera and a camera move here is not read-only — `onMove` → `markDirty` persists
  the viewport and casts it to the team session — so it refuses while the kanban board is up and
  while focus is in a text surface (input/textarea/contenteditable/Monaco/xterm, where Shift+1 is
  just the `!` key), and on auto-repeat (both actions animate; a held chord would restart the tween).
  Desktop ⌘0 does NOT arrive as a keydown: the default menu's `resetZoom` accelerator wins, so
  `main/index.ts` intercepts it in `before-input-event` and forwards `app:zoom-actual-size`, which
  re-asks the same refusals. Server Edition needs no intercept (no menu; Chrome/Firefox hand ⌘0 to
  the page) and stubs the subscription.
- **"Go to node" (`goToNode` → `frameNode`)** — the one camera-travel path (notification click,
  sessions sidebar, ⌘K jump, presence travel, minimap double-click, double-click focus).
  **It computes the viewport itself and applies it with `setViewport`. It must never go through
  `fitView`.** React Flow's `fitView` frames nothing when you call it: it sets `fitViewQueued` and
  the fit is RESOLVED LATER — from a subsequent `setNodes` (and only once EVERY node is measured,
  `nodesInitialized`) or from the next `updateNodeInternals` — against whatever `nodeLookup` holds
  by then. Its fit set is also filtered by `measured` (no `width`/`height` fallback in
  `getFitViewNodes`), so a set that comes out EMPTY collapses the bounds to `{0,0,0,0}` and
  `getViewportForBounds` parks the canvas **ORIGIN** in the middle of the screen at max zoom. On a
  canvas whose nodes sit thousands of px out that is the field report verbatim: right project,
  empty stretch of canvas, *sometimes*. **Cross-project** focus lands in that window every time —
  switch project → load its nodes → frame the target, all before the mount-time measuring has
  settled — and the second click always works, which is what makes it read as intermittent.
  The geometry is `renderer/lib/nodeFocus.ts`: the node's rect from React Flow's own measurement
  when it has one (`getInternalNode` — `measured` reaches OUR node objects one render later via
  `onNodesChange`, and `internals.positionAbsolute` also accounts for `extent:'parent'` clamping),
  else `nodeFitRect` from the PERSISTED size, resolving the group-parent chain. Then
  `viewportForRect`: **centred in the pane, and nothing else.** Framing a single focused node
  against the chrome-free rectangle was tried twice and is wrong both ways — centred IN that rect
  ("too far right on an ultrawide, half off-screen on a laptop") and centred in the pane then
  nudged clear of it ("still not in the middle") — because `.sessions-sidebar` is a 300px absolute
  OVERLAY and it is open exactly when this feature is used, so either rule pushes the node right by
  most of its width. The couple of dozen pixels that end up behind the sidebar cost far less than
  losing the centre. The free-rect solve (`solveFitFrame` / `solveFitPadding`) stays where it earns
  its keep: `fitAll`, which fits EVERY node and would otherwise tuck them under the dock.
  Unknowable size or no pane ⇒ the camera **stands still**.
  **ONE exception, and it is not a walk-back of that rule (issue #743): a MAXIMIZED node**
  (`isMaximized` — `data.premaxRect`, the flag `maximizeNodeToRect` writes and
  `restoreMaximizedNode` clears) is framed against the same rectangle `maximizeTargetRect` placed
  it in, through `viewportForNodeFocus`, which passes `measureMaximizeInsets(box)` to
  `viewportForRect` only for maximized nodes. `nodeFocus.policy.test.ts` exercises this shared
  Canvas decision for ordinary, maximized and restored nodes in both zoom modes.
  Maximize also measures `.controls-cluster` and `.dock` (#711): their screen rectangles reserve
  top/bottom space with an 8px gap, consuming the existing 24px margin first. Chrome outside the
  horizontally usable area contributes nothing. Menus and hover peeks never reserve a band. Both
  focus zoom branches use these same vertical insets; refitting observes the persistent chrome
  as well as pinned panels and compares all four insets. Zone snap retains its side-only policy. The trade-off above rests on
  ONE number — how much of the node ends up behind the panel — and for a maximized node that
  number is set by the PANEL rather than the node, **by construction**: maximize sized it to be
  *exactly* the free area, so centring it in the wider pane buries half the inset less the margin.
  Measured by the reporter on a signed v0.3.5 build with the sidebar pinned: an ordinary node lost
  33px, the maximized one 137px, and the camera drifted by `322 / 2 = 161` px on every "go to
  another node and back". Because the node is that rectangle minus two margins, centring it in the
  free area reproduces maximize's own origin (`marginPx + insets.left`) exactly — which is what
  makes this a fix rather than a second opinion about placement. It applies to BOTH zoom branches
  (the rectangle question is the same one; splitting it would be two rectangles again, which is
  the bug). With no pinned panels or overlapping persistent controls, `insets` is zero.
  A pane narrower than the panels over it falls back to the whole pane rather than solving against
  a negative width. `measureMaximizeInsets` reads the DOM only when framing a maximized node.
  `settings.focusZoomToNode` (Behavior, default ON) is the escape hatch for the rescale: off, the
  camera keeps the zoom `getZoom()` reports and only pans, and that zoom is passed through
  **unclamped** — it is one the canvas is already displaying, and re-clamping it to the framing
  range would rescale the view the option exists to leave alone. Two rules a refactor must not
  undo: framing goes through `frameNode` and nothing else (`canvas-wiring.test.tsx` pins that it
  contains no `fitView(`), and a "stands still" branch must never be "helpfully" replaced by a bare
  `fitView` — that IS the origin jump. `fitAll` still uses `fitView` deliberately: it is an
  explicit user gesture on a settled canvas and its fit set is every node, but it carries the same
  deferral, so do not reach for it from anything automatic.
- **Breadcrumb trail** (`renderer/lib/breadcrumbs.ts` — all the pure logic lives there) — every
  deliberate `goToNode` landing records a `NavStop` ({nodeId, at, note}) for the ACTIVE project, and
  **Cmd+[ / Cmd+]** (`canvas.goBack` / `canvas.goForward`, bound in `shared/keybindings.ts`) plus the
  two Dock buttons walk that trail; on a project activation a once-per-app-run **`ResumeCard`** offers
  the last few distinct stops ("resume where you left off") — **opt-in via
  `settings.showResumeCard` (Settings → Appearance, default OFF)**: while disabled the
  once-per-app-run slot is not spent, so enabling it later still shows the card on the next
  activation; the chords/Dock buttons work regardless. Load-bearing facts:
  - **The trail is MACHINE-LOCAL and rides `IndexEntryV3.breadcrumbs`, never `.nodeterm/project.json`** —
    the same tier as `viewport` / `defaultAccountId` / `capabilityAck`, for the same reason: a repo must
    not carry one person's camera history to everyone who clones it. `fileToProject` therefore ignores a
    `breadcrumbs` field found in the shared file (a forgery), and `projectToFile` never writes one.
  - **The cursor is not persisted either.** Only `list` rides the entry; `BreadcrumbState.index` is
    renderer-only and resets to the tip on activation. A step records no breadcrumb and rewrites no
    `project.json` — the only persistence it triggers is the ordinary `onMove` viewport persist
    (machine-local, same as any camera move; see the Zoom-chords bullet).
  - **Cap 20** (`BREADCRUMB_CAP`, oldest dropped) and a **3 s dedupe** (`BREADCRUMB_DEDUPE_MS`, so a
    re-triggered focus on the already-current node is a no-op — `recordBreadcrumb` returns the SAME
    object, which is the caller's skip test). Recording past a back-step drops the forward tail, exactly
    like a browser tab.
  - **`stepBreadcrumb` skips stops whose node is gone** (never lands on a dead entry; no reachable stop
    ⇒ `null` ⇒ the camera stands still), and `goToNode` **refuses to record ephemeral `subagent` / `loop`
    nodes**: they are merged into the `<ReactFlow nodes>` prop but never persisted (cleared on the next
    turn), so a breadcrumb for one is an id nothing can ever resolve, burning a slot forever.
  - The `note` is a **snapshot** taken at record time (agent nodes reuse the sessions sidebar's own
    `sessionStatusKind` + `STATE_LABEL` phrasing, preferring session name → node title → agent label), so
    a later state change never retroactively rewrites history.
  - **Surfaces:** Server Edition works as-is (shared renderer code + `WorkspaceStore`, which both
    shells boot — no new bridge member); mobile is N/A (no canvas, no camera); the kanban board is
    likewise N/A, and a project that activates ON the board neither shows nor spends its
    once-per-run resume card (it would sit invisible under the opaque overlay).
- **Canvas layouts** (`@shared/canvas-layout`, `renderer/lib/canvasLayout.ts` capture/apply +
  `renderer/lib/canvasLayoutView.ts` for the menu wording and the fallback camera; Dock button
  after "Fit view", mirrored in ⌘K) - a NAMED SNAPSHOT OF NODE GEOMETRY (position, size,
  collapse state) per project, so an arrangement built for the ultrawide can be restored after a
  day on the laptop screen. Load-bearing rules:
  - **Geometry only, and that is the whole safety story.** A restore never creates, deletes,
    renames, recolors, reparents or respawns a node, and never touches a tmux session - so the
    worst a bad layout can do is move things, which ⌘Z takes back (the debounced history effect
    picks up the `setNodes` like any other placement, which is why restore has no confirm and
    delete does).
  - **The two DESTRUCTIVE row actions confirm; restore does not, and the split is the undo stack.**
    ⌘Z replays node arrays, and a layout lives beside them rather than in them, so delete and
    "update to the arrangement on screen" are both unrecoverable the moment they run while a restore
    is one undo away. Update exists because the three-step alternative already worked (save, retype
    the name you are looking at, confirm the replace) and re-typing a name is friction, not a
    decision; it reuses `saveLayout`'s replace-by-id path, so `createdAt` survives, `updatedAt`
    moves, and the window size and camera are re-captured because you are updating FROM this screen.
    Both dialogs are built from `layoutIsShared` + `deleteLayoutMessage`/`updateLayoutMessage`
    (`canvasLayoutView.ts`), ONE definition of who else a destructive edit reaches: a folder project
    and an SSH project both keep their `project.json` where other people read it, and only a
    cwd-less canvas does not. Gating that on `cwd` alone (the first version) told an SSH project's
    user their edit was private when it was not. The layout is re-resolved AT CONFIRM TIME, never
    captured with the dialog: it is open for as long as the user looks at it, and a pull or a peer
    mutation can retire it underneath.
  - **The content half is git-shared, the camera half is machine-local.** `Project.layouts` rides
    `.nodeterm/project.json` beside `nodes` and `kanban`, because node geometry is already shared
    content in that file and a restore writes exactly those fields. `Project.layoutViewports` (this
    machine's camera per layout) rides `IndexEntryV3` in `workspace.json`. **The camera precedent
    (`viewport`, `breadcrumbs`) deliberately does NOT reach the geometry**: those are facts about
    where one person was looking, and nobody else's canvas moves when I pan - but where the nodes
    SIT is the canvas itself, and sharing an arrangement with the repo is the point.
  - **Restore rules** (`applyLayout`, pure + tested): a live node the layout does not mention is
    left exactly where it is, never tidied or stacked at the origin; an entry whose node is gone is
    skipped and counted, never resurrected; a frame the layout addresses gets the rect the user
    saved and is NOT re-fitted afterwards (the fit would overwrite it and the arrangement would
    drift a little on every restore), while a frame the layout does not mention but whose
    descendant just moved IS re-fitted, deepest first, so an out-of-layout child cannot be clamped
    by `extent:'parent'` into an inverted range. The whole layout lands in ONE transform as an
    explicit two-pass (resolve every target root origin, then emit) - a reduce over N placements
    re-fits an ancestor between two of them, so the second node is measured against a frame the
    first just moved and the result is differently wrong depending on array order. `collapsed` is
    restored with the CHROME height on the node and the real one in `expandedHeight` (the
    `flowToNodeStates` rule: the stored height is ALWAYS the expanded one, or a
    save-while-collapsed shrinks the node permanently). `premaxRect` and every non-geometry field
    ride the spread untouched - a restore is a placement, not a maximize.
  - **The camera is applied with `setViewport`, NEVER `fitView`** - the "Go to node" invariant
    above, and a canvas that has just been rearranged is exactly the unmeasured state where a
    queued fit collapses the bounds and flies to the origin. This machine's recorded camera wins;
    a layout restored here for the first time (a teammate's, or one saved on another machine) gets
    `layoutFramingViewport`, which is the core `framingViewport` rule rewritten locally because the
    renderer has no import path into `src/core` and because a layout's rects are ROOT-space, so
    unlike `CanvasNodeState` positions every entry anchors the camera.
  - **The window size is a LABEL, never a matcher.** `CanvasLayout.window` is the author's window
    at save time, shown in the menu so the user can tell the two arrangements apart. Nothing
    auto-applies a layout on a display change: the file travels, so matching on it would pick a
    stranger's monitor for this user's screen - and a canvas that rearranges itself when you plug
    in a projector is worse than one that does not.
  - **Cap 20** (`CANVAS_LAYOUTS_CAP`; a full node-geometry list in a file that is committed and
    cloned), name capped at 60, and **both sanitized on BOTH serializer seams** (`fileToProject`
    on the way in, `projectToFile` on the way out) - the same two-seam rule `normalizeNodeIcon`
    and `sanitizeNodeTriggers` follow, because live node data is reachable by a peer canvas
    mutation and whatever we write is what the next machine trusts. `sanitizeLayouts` DROPS a
    layout whole rather than repairing it: a repaired layout no longer describes the arrangement it
    is named after, and a non-finite coordinate is a white-screen crash (`adoptUserNodes`
    dereferences the position unguarded) that `JSON.stringify` then writes back as `null`.
  - **Downgrade note:** a build older than this one drops `layouts` on its first save, because
    `projectToFile` builds an explicit object and simply does not know the field. The layouts are
    gone from that checkout's file until someone on a current build saves again; nothing else
    breaks, and the machine-local cameras are pruned to match on the next load.
  - **Surfaces:** Desktop full; **Server Edition full with NO new IPC** (pure renderer plus
    `workspace.save`, which both shells already boot); **relay tabs REFUSED with the reason** -
    the Dock button is disabled with "Layouts are managed on the host" and the ⌘K entries are
    omitted (the palette has no disabled row), because a relay tab is a live connection to another
    machine and never a workspace on this disk; kanban N/A (a board shows cards, and geometry is
    what a column layout discards); mobile N/A - *nodeterm mobile* attaches to tmux sessions over
    the transport protocol and has no canvas, so surfacing a layout means extending that protocol
    (follow-up in the iOS repo).
- **Command palette** (`CommandPalette.tsx`): ⌘/Ctrl+K; `Canvas.buildCommands` (create,
  switch project, jump to node by title/tag, open file…).
- **Explorer** (`ExplorerPanel.tsx`, 🗂 / ⌘⇧E): lazy file tree of the active project `cwd`
  (`fs:list`); click a file → opens an editor node; right-click → Copy Path / Reveal /
  **New File… / New Folder…** (empty-area right-click targets the root; SSH projects create on the
  host). Canvas pane right-click and ⌘K also expose **New file…** (creates under the project cwd,
  opens an editor node). These use `mkdir` + `exists` added to `FsApi`/`SshFsApi` across
  desktop/server/SSH (`core/fs-ops.ts`, `main/ssh-fs.ts`). **Relay tabs are NOT degraded**: a
  relay tab's `fs` routes through `bridge/relay-api.ts:86` (`fs: files.fs`) → `buildFilesApi`'s
  `IPC.fsMkdir`/`IPC.fsExists` (`bridge/ws-bridge.ts:474-475`) → `core/fs-handlers.ts:43-44` →
  the real `fsOps.makeDir`/`fsOps.pathExists` on the peer's core, so both verbs are live there.
  What genuinely still lacks them is the legacy PHONE vocabulary
  (`main/remote/host-service.ts`), whose `handleFs` switches on `fs.list`/`read`/`readBinary`/
  `write` and nothing else, so `fs.mkdir`/`fs.exists` fall through to the dispatcher's
  `Unknown method` **rejection** (line 695) rather than degrading to `false` — a different
  dispatch path (`relay-host.ts:22-24`) from the relay tab above.
  Expanded dirs **persist per project** across drawer close + app restart (`state/explorer.ts`
  zustand store, localStorage `nodeterm.explorerExpanded`). The header pin docks it like the
  sessions sidebar (`lib/explorerPin.ts`, `nodeterm.explorerPinned`, default off): overlay
  click-outside closes the modal only, and a pinned overlay is `pointer-events: none` so it
  cannot steal canvas clicks. × is a transient hide and does not clear the pin. Pinned z-index
  is 26 so the tree stays visible on the kanban board with the controls cluster. Desktop +
  Server Edition (personal `localStorage`). Mobile companion: N/A — no explorer there. Source
  Control stays a modal.
- **Source Control** (`main/git-service.ts` system `git` + `gh`, `SourceControlPanel.tsx`,
  ⎇): file-level **stage/unstage** (+/−), **discard**, click a file → **diff node**,
  **branch switch/create**, commit (message box at top) + push / sync / publish, **gh
  sign-in** banner (runs `gh auth login` in a new terminal via `initialCommand`), recent
  commits. **AI commit message** (✦ Generate) and **AI terminal naming** both use
  `main/commit-message.ts`: a BYO local agent CLI (claude/codex/custom) spawned read-only on
  the staged diff / captured terminal output (no built-in model); agent + extra prompt in
  Settings. The panel operates on a **selected scope**, not on the project cwd — see Worktrees.
  **Open latency + reopen**: `status()` must never await `gh auth status` — it hits the GitHub
  API (~700ms) and used to hold the panel's first paint hostage; `ghAuthedSwr()` returns the
  cached answer and refreshes in the background (the accurate `ghAuthed()` is still awaited on
  the publish flow). Status/history live in the per-cwd `state/scmCache.ts` store (same pattern
  as `scmDraft`), so the close→reopen cycle paints the last-known data instantly while the
  mount refresh replaces it silently — do not move them back into component `useState`.
  **Branch observations** (`state/gitBranches.ts`) are shared by Source refreshes, Sessions project
  headers and existing worktree status polls. They are scoped by GitApi identity + exact cwd + SSH
  project id, never persisted, and latest-started reads win over late responses. Sessions resolves
  each project's owning session (including background projects); its header reads the project cwd,
  while a group header reads only its worktree path. No new timer: sidebar mount/reopen/cwd changes
  read local checkouts once, Source operations refresh as before, and worktrees keep their existing
  gated cadence.
  SSH headers only observe Source refreshes: background SSH connections are not git-routable.
  Local header probes also skip a cwd claimed by the active SSH route.
  The branch projection does not replace worktree staleness/ownership decisions or SCM history.
- **Worktrees** (bound to **group frames**) — a git worktree binds to a group node
  (`data.worktree: GroupWorktree {repoPath, branch, baseRef, path, createdByApp}`, persisted), and
  every node created inside that frame inherits the worktree path as its `cwd`
  (`cwdForNewNodeIn`) — the frame *is* the binding, so an agent per branch is just a group per
  branch. Creation is **one step** — **"New worktree…"** from the pane menu / command palette /
  Source Control — with the repo resolved from the project cwd via `git.repoRoot()` and existing
  worktrees listed for adoption. (Both git IPCs existed before this feature and had **zero**
  renderer callers, which is why it was unusable: the dialog's repo field was always empty and had
  to be typed by hand. Don't re-strand them.)
  - **Default location** — `settings.worktreePathTemplate` is a machine-global Behavior setting,
    expanded only by `shared/worktree.computeWorktreePath` for both the dialog and canvas-control
    CLI. It is relative to the repo root and supports `$repoName` (`$reponame` /
    `$defaultFolderName` aliases) and `$branch` in bare or `${…}` form. If branch is omitted, its
    safe slug is appended automatically. The shipped `../${repoName}.worktrees/${branch}` keeps
    worktrees beside — not nested inside — the main checkout. There is no general project-settings
    surface today, so the setting is intentionally global rather than hidden in a one-off menu.
  - **One store, one poller** — `renderer/state/worktrees.ts` is the **only** caller of the worktree
    /status *read* IPCs (`git.repoRoot`, `git.worktreeList`, `git.status`); the group chip, the
    creation dialog and the Source Control panel all read that store. Three independent pollers would
    triple the `git` subprocess load and drift out of sync. It is **epoch-guarded** (a project switch
    bumps the epoch, so a stale in-flight refresh can never overwrite the newer project's
    `repoRoot`/orphans — worktrees are *created* under `repoRoot` and orphans are offered for
    *deletion*) and **fails open**. Exactly **two** direct `git.status` reads live outside it, both in
    `Canvas.tsx` and both deliberate: the one-shot probes on the **Remove** confirm (the dirty-file
    count in the warning) and on **↪ Move into worktree** (staleness only arrives by poll, so the
    directory is re-checked immediately before an irreversible session kill). Anything recurring
    belongs in the store.
  - **Scoped Source Control** — the panel operates on a selected `ScmScope` (the main checkout or a
    bound worktree). A worktree scope's **id is its group node id**, which is what lets the canvas
    selection preselect it. `scmScopes` / `defaultScmScope` / `selectedScmGroupId`
    (`shared/scm-scope.ts`) decide the list and the default. The panel derives its `cwd` **once** so
    its ~49 call sites follow — and every Canvas callback it invokes (`onOpenDiff`,
    `onOpenCommitDiff`, `onExplainCommit`, `onRunInTerminal`) must take the **scope's** cwd, never
    the project's.
  - **Reconciliation** (`shared/worktree-reconcile.ts`) — bindings are reconciled against `git
    worktree list`: a worktree deleted outside the app makes its group **stale** (chip reads
    "· missing", Merge/Remove hide, ↪ hides, and nothing spawns into the dead path — Unbind is the
    only action, and it takes the dead cwd off the children with it); a worktree bound to no group
    is an **orphan**, recoverable from the creation dialog.
  - **Two non-obvious facts the code depends on — do not "simplify" these away:**
    1. `git worktree list --porcelain` **keeps listing a worktree whose directory was deleted
       behind git's back**, tagging it `prunable` — and that tag only exists on **git ≥ 2.36**. So
       `worktreeList` additionally **stats** each path through an injected `pathExists` seam
       (`prunable: e.prunable || !pathExists(path)`; `git-service` wires `fs.existsSync`), or the
       whole stale/orphan story silently fails on the Server Edition's own target platform (Debian 11
       / Ubuntu 20.04 ship git 2.30).
    2. **A failed git read is never evidence of absence.** `listWorktrees` returns `{ok, entries}`
       so "git failed" (spawn EAGAIN, NFS hiccup, corrupt index) stays distinguishable from "git
       listed nothing" — a transient failure must never be read as "the worktree is gone", at any
       layer (`ok:false` changes no facts). Staleness from the status poll likewise needs **two
       consecutive** failed reads (`WORKTREE_STALE_STRIKES`), and the streak is scoped per project
       so a there-and-back tab switch cannot forget it.
  - **Destructive safety** — `createdByApp` gates removal: nodeterm deletes only worktrees it
    created; one the user merely **adopted** unbinds by default, and deleting its directory is an
    explicit opt-in that **defaults to off** (its branch is kept either way).
    `isDangerousWorktreeRemovalPath` refuses a path that is the repo, `$HOME`, `/`, or an ancestor
    of any of them, on **every** removal path. **Merge** always confirms — it merges into the base's
    *working tree* (`decideMergeStrategy`: merge in the base's checkout when it is clean, else a
    `fetch . branch:base` when the base is checked out nowhere, else blocked) — and its push to
    `origin/<base>` is disclosed in that dialog and **opt-in, default off**: a push to origin cannot
    be politely undone.
  - **Every path that drops a bound group goes through unbind** — Unbind, Remove, **Ungroup** and
    **Delete** all route through `releaseWorktreeBinding`, the one place that knows what a dropped
    binding owes: `displacedByWorktree`'s descendants (terminals whose cwd sits inside the
    worktree) get that cwd taken off them, and git's registration gets a `pruneOnly` prune. Ungroup
    and group-delete *keep* the children, so skipping this left a **dead cwd persisted in
    `project.json`** — invisible until a reboot cold-starts the terminal into a directory that is not
    there — and left a stale registration that makes a later `worktree add` at the same path fail.
  - **SSH projects: not supported in v1** — every affordance is shown **disabled with that reason**
    (a silently-missing row teaches nothing). The gate asks whether the node is a **remote session**
    (`data.ssh` / `data.sshRemoteTmux`) or the project is an SSH project — **not** `data.remote`,
    which only *relay* nodes carry: guarding the wrong field let a live remote tmux session be
    killed into a local path that does not exist on the host (`isRemoteSessionNode` asks about all
    three). The ops themselves **refuse** a remote repo (`git-service.isRemoteRepo`, via
    `resolveGitRemote`) rather than guess: the `git` executor routes over the project's ControlMaster
    while `pathExists` is a **local** `fs.existsSync`, so answering would stat the wrong machine and
    report *everything is gone* — a refusal is a plain failed op and, crucially, never `worktreeGone`,
    so nothing is destroyed on a bad guess. Real support needs the worktree path to derive from the
    connection's cached `remoteHome` and `pathExists` to stat the **remote** fs (a `test -e` over the
    ControlMaster).
  - **Mobile companion: not applicable in v1** (the three-surfaces call, made deliberately). A
    worktree binds to a **group frame** on the canvas, and *nodeterm mobile* (separate repo, `nodeterm-ios`)
    has no canvas — it attaches to tmux sessions over the `TerminalTransport` protocol, which carries
    no group/binding concept at all. So there is nothing to degrade gracefully: a worktree's terminals
    are ordinary tmux sessions and mobile already reaches them, it simply cannot see that they belong
    to a worktree. Surfacing the binding (a read-only "worktree: <branch>" label per session, say)
    would mean extending the transport protocol — a **follow-up in the iOS repo**, not this branch.
    Creation/merge/remove stay desktop+server only: they are destructive git operations, and a phone
    is the last place to confirm one.
  - **Known follow-up** — the Explorer tree and the ⌘K file index stay scoped to the **project cwd**,
    so a bound worktree's files are not browsable/searchable from them (its terminals and editor
    nodes work fine). Deliberately out of scope here: both index a single root, and making them
    scope-aware is the same "which checkout am I looking at?" question Source Control already answers
    with `ScmScope` — that is the seam to reuse when it is built.
- **Kanban view** (`components/kanban/KanbanView.tsx`; toggle is a Trello-style icon ON the
  **active project tab** (`.tab__board-toggle`, after the name, before the caret — the view
  belongs to the project; earlier homes were the tab-strip end, then the controls-cluster,
  both rejected in use) plus ⌘⇧B / ⌘K): per-project
  full-page board OVER the canvas. It is **dual-source** (PR #90): SESSION cards are the project's
  session nodes (React Flow type `terminal`), derived LIVE from the canvas nodes
  (title/color/kind/agentId), with RUNNING / NEEDS YOU badges + unread dot from the default
  `agentStatus` store (click = back to canvas + `focusNodeById`); GITHUB cards are the repo's
  issues (`GitHubIssueCardView` via `state/githubIssues.ts`, opened through
  `GitHubIssueSummaryModal`, a column move that closes/reopens the issue confirms first). A
  **source filter** (`KanbanSourceFilter`: All / Issues / Pull requests / Sessions) and a transient
  per-board **label filter** narrow what shows.
  **PULL REQUEST cards are harvested from the issue poll, not fetched** (2026-09-01, read-only):
  `/repos/{repo}/issues` returns pull requests too — `client.listIssues` used to `continue` past
  them — so keeping them costs ZERO extra requests and inherits the incremental `since` watermark,
  the ETags, the 60 s poll and the cache snapshot the issue lane already has. The alternative was
  measured and rejected: **`/repos/{repo}/pulls` IGNORES `since`** (a day-old `since` returned the
  same 100 items as none), each item is ~25 KB against ~7 KB, and it would be a second
  ETag/paging/cache lineage — for `head`/`base` and nothing else (mergeable, reviews and checks are
  per-PR legs either way). The harvest's fields are `draft` and `pull_request.merged_at` (**the only
  thing separating merged from closed** — both report `state: 'closed'`), plus the labels/assignees
  the issue shape already carries. There is **no `head`** in that payload: `GitHubPullMeta.head`
  stays undefined until something asks per branch (`/repos/{repo}/pulls?head=owner:branch`), which
  is one request per question rather than a field on every poll.
  Three rules the harvest brought with it: **(1)** one snapshot now holds both kinds, so
  `GitHubIssueQuery.kind` (absent = `'issue'`) is what keeps the issue lane's items and counts
  byte-identical to before — and `moveIssue` refuses a PR by number (`invalid-target`) because the
  two share a number space and its membership check alone would hand one to a write path that
  cannot serve it. **(2)** `MAX_ISSUES` / the 64 MB bound are shared, so an overflow **evicts pull
  requests first, oldest-updated first** (`evictPullsToFit`) and marks the snapshot
  `pullsTruncated`; the existing `incomplete` read-only path fires only if the issues ALONE still
  miss the bound. A repository large enough to overflow degrades in the new half, never in the
  board it already had. An incremental pass carries the flag forward — it never re-fetches what it
  dropped, so only a full reconciliation may clear it. **(3)** the `pulls` source is `readOnly` in
  the registry: no drag, no move control, and its page reports `readOnly: true` on the wire rather
  than trusting every consumer to remember.
  **Where a card comes from is a registry, not a branch per call site** (`renderer/lib/kanbanSources.ts`,
  2026-08-30 — the same membership-plus-one-leaf discipline `AGENT_CONFIG` uses): each entry declares
  its filter `label`, its `placement` (`assignment` = the board's own persisted assignments,
  reorderable within a column; `provider` = the provider reports the column, the board persists
  nothing and a move is the provider's write), its in-column `lane` order and whether it is
  `configured` for a given board. Two orders live there deliberately: **declaration order is the
  source filter's button order** (All · GitHub · Sessions), **`lane` is the in-column stacking order**
  (sessions above issues) — they genuinely differ, and pinning both is what stops either being
  re-spelled elsewhere. `KanbanColumn` therefore takes ONE `lanes` prop (`{sourceId, cards, footer?,
  count}`) instead of a `cards` + eight `github*` props, places them via `byLane` and names no source;
  the board builds each source's leaf, and the drag union branches on `placement` (`isProviderDrag`)
  rather than on the string `'github'`. A lane's `count` is passed rather than derived from
  `cards.length` because a provider reports a server-side total larger than the page fetched so far.
  What deliberately did NOT move into the registry: the virtual **Ungrouped** column (board
  semantics, not a source's concern) and `validKanban`, which stays the single shape gate on every
  load path — a registry entry must never grow its own parallel validation. **Labels** are a per-project palette (`ProjectKanban` labels,
  edited inline via the Notion-style `LabelPicker`: create/assign/rename/recolor/delete through the
  pure `lib/kanban.ts` transforms) plus each GitHub issue's own labels, both filterable. The canvas stays MOUNTED under the opaque overlay (agent-status
  listeners live in Canvas.tsx; `display:none` would 0×0-resize every terminal into a tmux
  SIGWINCH), and canvas-only shortcuts (undo, ⌘T/⌘⇧C, Delete) early-return via `isKanbanOpen`.
  Board data is `project.kanban` ({columns, assignments: [{nodeId, columnId}]}, order = array
  order) in `.nodeterm/project.json` — git-shared, rides rev/mirror/watcher; absent until the
  first edit (`defaultKanban` seeds To Do / In Progress / Done). The virtual **Ungrouped**
  column (never persisted, undeletable/unrenamable, always first) holds every session with no —
  or dangling — assignment, in canvas order, so the board never opens empty. **Assignment is
  board metadata only**: drags never move canvas nodes or change groups; dead nodes' assignments
  prune lazily on each board change (`pruneAssignments`). Column delete is confirm-free (cards
  return to Ungrouped; no last-column rule — Ungrouped remains). The one shape rule is
  `validKanban` (`core/workspace-files.ts`), applied on EVERY load path — `fileToProject` AND
  `loadV3`'s inline (cwd-less) branch, which bypasses fileToProject — so a v1 `{columns, cards}`
  or hand-mangled board drops to the fresh default instead of crashing the render (view choice
  persists in localStorage, so a render throw would boot-loop). Pure transforms in
  `renderer/lib/kanban.ts`; view choice is personal (`state/viewMode.ts`, localStorage
  `nodeterm.projectView`). The board opens with a **title strip** (`.kanban-header`: project
  dot + name) whose height clears the floating controls-cluster icons — columns never sit under
  them. **Cards collapse/expand on single click** (transient state); the expanded detail row
  reuses `ContextMeter` (model + % pill, per the node header) + session chip + an ↗
  open-on-canvas button; double-click opens the node directly. Z-order contract: overlay 25 <
  `.controls-cluster` 26 (Explorer/SC/Settings stay clickable ON the board) < `.top-banners` 27
  (a mandatory-update card must not hide behind the board) < tabbar 30. An assigned session
  node shows its column as a **half-pill flush on the node's TOP edge** — see the pill sentence
  below. A card's ↗ / double-click opens the **card modal** (`components/kanban/CardModal.tsx`, body
  portal on the dialog-stack, scrim z 55, scrim/Esc close — Esc in CAPTURE phase, and an Esc
  during a header rename only cancels the edit). Terminal cards get a LIVE second view of the
  tmux session (`ModalTerminal.tsx`): the pty subscriber ledger is keyed by the composite
  `(ClientId, viewerId ?? PRIMARY)` (`core/pty-manager.ts` — **viewer identity**; viewerId is an
  optional TRAILING arg through preload/ws-bridge/LocalTransport, absent = bit-for-bit legacy, and
  a client's per-connection socket pause survives a single view's departure). The modal viewer
  seed-paints from the joiner screen (`toXtermText` transforms — raw capture-pane staircases),
  handles fresh-cold via scrollback snapshot + hint (agent auto-resume stays canvas-only), has
  deliberately no park/WebGL/hover/flow-control, and kills ONLY its own viewer on close. Sticky
  cards edit their text in the modal (live both ways).
  The modal header carries the terminal node's actions (search via `useTerminalSearch`+
  `FindBar` on the modal xterm; dictate via the same `nodeterm:dictate` event — `.dictation`
  overlay z is 60, ABOVE the modal scrim; ✦ `pty.generateName` through the modal rename funnel;
  and the **⌘M view** — a header toggle (`IconMarkdown`) plus the chord, which lays the SAME face
  the canvas node shows over the live viewer: `ChatPanel` when `canChat(created agent)` and the
  session id is known, else `TerminalMarkdownView`. Three rules: the state is MODAL-LOCAL and per OPENING
  (never `data.mdMode` — that would flip the canvas node under the board too); the viewer
  stays MOUNTED underneath (covered, not swapped, so its co-attach never detaches/re-attaches) and
  gets the same focus hand-off as the node (`ModalTerminal`'s `covered` → `useMdModeFocus`); and the
  chord reaches the modal through `window.nodeTerminal.onMarkdownToggle` only while it is the top
  dialog, while the canvas terminal AND editor nodes' own subscriptions refuse the chord whenever a
  board is up (`lib/markdownChord.ts` `canvasOwnsMarkdownChord` — a hover flag can go stale under
  the opaque board, so one press could otherwise flip both). The header also carries the node's
  pause chips — DROPPED, PAUSED and SLEEPING (Eco, with the refused-wake sentence) — each clicking
  through the same `wakeHibernatedNode` trigger as the canvas chip. The overlay sits at z 5 in the pane, BELOW the
  sheet's resize handles (z 6/7, issue #389) — pinned in `styles.kanban.test.ts`.
  **The 💬 icon means COMMENTS on both surfaces** (repurposed from the markdown view — ⌘M still
  toggles markdown/chat on the canvas node, and on the card modal): on a terminal node it opens a right-side comments
  flyout (`.term-node__comments`, a sibling of the overflow:hidden root, hosting BoardLogPanel
  with `card: Pick<KanbanSession,'id'>`); in the modal it collapses/reopens the panel, which is
  OPEN BY DEFAULT there. Under the modal header sits the **card metadata strip** (`CardMetaBar.tsx`): Members (assign) —
  colored initial avatars, picker pool = me + live presence peers + board-log authors (name-keyed,
  NO separate membership system) — and a Due date (`datetime-local`, red Overdue chip past due;
  cards show mini avatars + a due chip). Data = `kanban.meta [{nodeId, assignees, dueAt, priority}]` (priority low/medium/high/urgent, colored chips)
  (tolerant readers via `cardMeta`; pruned with dead nodes; empty entries dropped). Assign/due
  changes are logged through the SAME diff funnel (`member-assigned/unassigned`, `due-set/cleared`,
  `priority-set/cleared`; agent-to-agent message deliveries are logged as `agent-message` by
  `agent-message-trace.recordDelivery`, where `from`/`to` are node ids and `title` is the outcome;
  unknown future event types render neutrally — the `BoardLogEvent.type` union in `shared/types.ts`
  is the source of truth). Feed rows show ABSOLUTE Trello-style stamps
  (relative in the tooltip). The modal's right third is the **board log** panel (`BoardLogPanel.tsx`, `state/boardLog.ts`):
  per-person comments + card activity from `<cwd>/.nodeterm/board-log.jsonl` — append-only JSONL
  (`core/board-log.ts`: tolerant newest-first parse cap 500; text clamped `BOARD_LOG_TEXT_MAX`
  16KB — an SSH append is ONE printf arg, ARG_MAX would silently drop it), author = presence
  identity, registered via `core/board-log-handlers.ts` in BOTH shells (client sends only a
  projectId — the path always derives from the server's own registry, no jail needed). Events
  come from ONE pure funnel (`lib/boardLogDiff.ts` — binding invariant: its `cardTitle` arg
  returns '' for and ONLY for dead nodes; column deletion suppresses per-card moved-to-Ungrouped
  noise; prunes/reorders log nothing) + `createNodeInColumn`'s card-created. Local projects push
  changes via fs.watch; desktop SSH projects poll 5s while subscribed; inline projects show a
  hint. Relay tabs BRIDGE boardLog to the host (pre-dispatch `sharedProjectId` scope guard in the
  relay dispatch — an out-of-scope projectId is refused before any registry/path resolution; a
  connection drop replays its outstanding onChanged unsubscribes). **The relay-guest scope jail is
  keyed on channel CLASS, not a per-feature list** (`main/remote/relay-project-scope.ts`): every
  method whose name starts with `githubIssues:` / `board-log:` / `projects.` is project-scoped, and
  one the table cannot read a projectId out of is REFUSED on a scoped session. The switch it
  replaced had a `default: not project-scoped` arm, so a new verb in one of those namespaces reached
  another project's data with no refusal anywhere. A new channel in a scoped class therefore needs a
  table row to become reachable — and `relay-project-scope.test.ts` fails if a live IPC channel in a
  scoped class has none, so the fail-closed default cannot silently swallow a shipped verb. Deliberate v1 gaps: column-level
  events are stored but no card feed shows them; canvas-born nodes get no card-created; no
  card-deleted type.
  Per-column "+ New session" menus create agents/terminal/sticky nodes assigned to the column
  (assignment written UN-pruned — the fresh node isn't in the derived list yet). The column
  half-pill itself: (`components/kanban/ColumnPill.tsx`, `columnForNode` in lib/kanban; rendered
  as a SIBLING of the node root — the roots are overflow:hidden — hidden for Ungrouped/dangling,
  click opens the board). Server Edition works as-is (pure renderer + workspace.save). Scope: no
  agent-driven card movement yet, no board undo.
  **Mobile (nodeterm-ios) reaches the board through three relay verbs**, all landing in
  `WorkspaceStore.ensureRemoteBoard` / `setRemoteCardColumn` / `editRemoteCardLabels` (host-service
  `handleKanban`; wired in `main/index.ts`'s `hostBridge.kanban`; pure transforms in
  `core/project-kanban-write.ts`): `projects.ensureBoard` seeds the default columns on a project that
  has none, `projects.setCardColumn` moves one card, and `projects.editCardLabels` adds / removes /
  creates **board labels** on one card (the phone's long-press label sheet, 2026-09). There is ONE
  label model — the per-project palette in `kanban.labels` plus per-card ids in `kanban.meta[].labels`
  — and the label verb writes it through the SAME transforms the canvas node's "+ Label" row and the
  kanban card use: the card-meta + label half of `lib/kanban.ts` moved to `@shared/kanban-labels`
  (re-exported, renderer call sites unchanged) so core can apply it; a test pins that a phone edit
  produces the board `toggleCardLabel` produces. Params are validated at the write site
  (`parseCardLabelEdit`: bounded control-free ids, 1–60-char control-free names, colour from the closed
  palette, no id both added and removed) because they land in a git-shared, hand-editable file; a
  created name matching an existing label case-insensitively REUSES it (the picker offers no Create
  on an exact match); the first label on a board-less project seeds the default board, as the
  desktop's first "+ Label" does; a stale `add` answers `edited:false` with the CURRENT palette so the
  phone can redraw. Deleting/renaming palette entries is deliberately desktop-only (it touches every
  card). The iOS direct-SSH path has a Swift twin of the transform for projects on the host it dials. Three things make them necessary rather than convenient. (1) The desktop board is a
  LAZY default — `kanban` is not written until the user's first board edit — so most project files
  carry NO board and the phone, which knows a project only by its file, could not offer one
  (measured: 1 of 13 project files on the author's machine had a `kanban` block). The default columns
  therefore live in `@shared/kanban-default-board`, read by `defaultKanban()` AND by the core seeder,
  and copied verbatim (under a pinning test on both sides) by iOS `KanbanDefaults`. (2) An SSH
  project's file is on a THIRD machine the phone has no credentials for; the verb writes the entry's
  `cache` and lets the ordinary mirror push it, which is exactly what a desktop card drag does — so
  it needs nothing new from `reconcileSsh` (that decides by `rev` and unions only `nodes`). Its cache
  change IS persisted to workspace.json, because for an ssh entry the cache is the local record. (3)
  The phone's older direct-SSH write inlines the whole project.json into one argv string and so dies
  at Linux's `MAX_ARG_STRLEN` — this repo's own `.nodeterm/project.json` measured 114,695 bytes,
  ~15 KB under the 128 KB ceiling. **Both verbs announce their write on `workspaceExternalChange`
  and that is not optional**: the renderer holds its own board and the next whole-workspace save
  serializes THAT, so a change the renderer never heard about is one the next autosave reverts.
- **Omni Kanban (global swimlanes)** (`components/kanban/GlobalKanbanView.tsx`; one swimlane per open project; `state/viewMode.ts` `globalKanban` (localStorage `nodeterm.globalKanban`, machine-local, like `viewByProject`) + `settings.omniKanbanEnabled` (feature gate, default OFF, `settings.json`) / `omniKanbanAsDefault` (when true, `view.kanbanToggle` — Cmd+Shift+B — opens Omni; otherwise per-project; `view.globalKanbanToggle` registry command — unbound, remappable — always opens Omni when enabled); `TabBar` and the menu IPC `onToggleKanban` share one `performKanbanToggle` decision, and `isGlobalKanbanOpen()` is the single gate (fail-closed, static import of `useSettings` — the earlier `require` failed open in the packaged renderer). The active project's lane is derived from serialized `p.nodes` via `toKanbanSessionState` — the persisted-state counterpart to `toKanbanSession` — and is committed (`commitActiveToStore`) before the overlay mounts so live React Flow edits are not stale; `pendingLaunch` never becomes `initialCommand` in the modal (the DAG launch must fire only when dependencies report done, and the canvas `TerminalNode` already delivers `initialCommand` via `writeWhenShellReady` after the `nodeterm:create-node` project switch). Active-project edits (rename / sticky / browser nav) route through Canvas live nodes (`setNodes` + `markDirty`), non-active through the store + `writeDisk`; delete uses `ConfirmDialog` (not `confirm`) and SSH-aware teardown (`transport.destroy` locally vs `sshProject.killSessions` with `everySocket` for a remote owner, plus `agentStatus` / `agentNodes` / `webviewKeepAlive` cleanup). The top bar's project pills and Cmd/Ctrl+1..9 (`nodeterm:swimlane-jump`) jump to the lane; header hint shows the correct mod (`Cmd` on Mac, `Ctrl` elsewhere). Server Edition works as-is, Mobile N/A.
- **Settings** (`SettingsPage.tsx`, ⚙ / ⌘,): font/cursor (live to xterm + Monaco), default
  shell, grid + snap, **default node size** (`defaultNodeWidth`/`defaultNodeHeight` — new
  terminal/agent nodes only, clamped in `terminalNodeSize()` in `state/workspace.ts`),
  pan-hover delay, double-click focus, accent, tmux on/scrollback, commit agent,
  `seenShortcuts`.
- **Shortcuts** (`ShortcutsPanel.tsx`, ? / ⌘/): shown once on first launch (`seenShortcuts`).
  **Derived from the registry, never hand-listed** — see the Keybindings invariant below.
- **Welcome** (`WelcomeScreen.tsx`): shown when no projects exist.
- **Nothing raises the window without a user action** (issue #737, the THIRD in this family —
  #665 and #702 were canvas-control moving the user's VIEW; this one is the OS window activating
  over another app). The cause was `win.on('ready-to-show', () => win.show())`: `ready-to-show`
  fires on the first paint of EVERY main-frame navigation, not once per window (MEASURED on
  Electron 42.9.1 — a `webContents.reload()` on a VISIBLE window emits it again with `isVisible()`
  already true), and the crash auto-reload (`render-process-gone` → `webContents.reload()`) is an
  unattended navigation. So a backgrounded renderer being killed — macOS jetsam on a machine
  running several agent CLIs at 335 MB–1.2 GB each — silently raised nodeterm over whatever the
  user had ⌘Tabbed to. It is `win.once` now. **The gate must be FIRST PAINT, not `isVisible()`**:
  after macOS hide-on-close the window is hidden but alive, and an `isVisible()` gate would `show()`
  it on a background reload — the same bug inverted.
  The permitted raises are all a CLICK, and they are enumerated with their triggering action in
  **`src/main/window-raise.guard.test.ts`**, an allowlist-with-reasons in the shape of
  `fs-atomic.guard.test.ts`: a notification tap (the one exception the rule names), a Notch HUD
  row, a Dock activate, a second launch, and a file dropped onto a terminal. Nothing an AGENT can
  do reaches any of them — canvas control, trigger nodes, hook POSTs, relay/pairing/push and
  browser-drive contain no show/focus/dialog call, and agent confirms are in-renderer
  `ConfirmDialog`s, never native. The drop IPC's `app.focus({steal:true})` is the only
  renderer-reachable cross-app activation and now carries the same sender guard its two neighbours
  (`uiShortcutRecording`, `uiTerminalFocus`) already had — a `<webview>` guest is a webContents in
  this process. **KNOWN GAP, listed in the guard rather than fixed**: `standing-host.ts`'s
  `dialog.showErrorBox` for a locked keyring is app-modal, unparented, and raised from the relay
  RECONNECT TIMER; the honest fix routes it to a non-modal in-app surface and owes a macOS check
  that a sheet on a background window does not activate.
- **Window geometry is REMEMBERED** (`main/window-state.ts`, `<userData>/window-state.json`) — size,
  position and maximized state, restored at the next launch. Before this the window opened at a
  hard-coded 1400x900 every time, on every platform, so a user who works maximized re-maximized it
  on every launch; Electron persists nothing on its own and no platform does it for us. The module
  is Electron-free in the `keydown-intercept.ts` shape (pure decisions over plain rectangles,
  structural window interfaces), so the refusals below can be pressed by a test instead of only by
  someone with two monitors — `screen.getAllDisplays()` is called at the seam in `index.ts` and its
  **work areas** (not full display bounds) are passed in. The refusals ARE the feature, because each
  is a way the naive version is worse than the fixed size it replaces:
  - **While MAXIMIZED the size comes from `getNormalBounds()`, never `getBounds()`.** The latter
    returns the MAXIMIZED rectangle, so saving it makes the next un-maximize hand back a
    screen-sized window — state that looks right and behaves wrong, and only for the users who
    maximize. **Un-maximized it is `getBounds()`**, which is the same rectangle wherever both work:
    Electron documents `getNormalBounds()` as supported only on some Linux desktop environments, and
    the common case must not depend on the window manager. The maximized case still does and cannot
    be helped from here, but it matters less, because that record restores by re-maximizing rather
    than by its size.
  - **A position that is no longer reachable is DROPPED, not clamped.** A laptop undocked from the
    monitor its window was on would otherwise reopen the app off-screen: running, focusable from the
    dock, visible nowhere, with no gesture that rescues it. Reachable means a real overlap with some
    work area (`MIN_VISIBLE_WIDTH`/`HEIGHT`), judged against the CLAMPED size — a few pixels on
    screen is not a title bar anyone can grab. **Overlap alone is not enough, because it is
    symmetric**: a monitor mounted ABOVE the laptop and then unplugged leaves a record whose BOTTOM
    edge clips the laptop's work area by enough to clear the height floor while the title bar sits
    hundreds of px above the screen — and under `titleBarStyle: 'hiddenInset'` the title bar is the
    whole drag region. So the window's TOP edge must also land on that work area, within
    `TOP_OVERHANG_SLACK` (24px, because window managers report decorations inconsistently and a few
    pixels of overhang must not cost the user their position every launch). The rule is per-display,
    like the overlap it joins. Dropping keeps the user's size and lets the platform place a window it
    knows how to place; inventing a corner for it is the guess.
  - **No capture while minimized or fullscreen.** `isMaximized()` is FALSE while a macOS window is
    fullscreen, so capturing there records `maximized: false` and erases exactly the preference this
    exists to remember. The last non-fullscreen state stands, which also means the app never reopens
    INTO fullscreen — deliberate: a fullscreen window is usually a temporary mode and is much harder
    to escape on first launch than a maximized one.
  - **Maximize before the first paint**, while the window is still `show: false`; maximizing after
    `show()` is a visible jump from the restored size on every launch.
  - Every field is **re-validated as a number on read** — the file is hand-editable and its values
    reach the `BrowserWindow` constructor before there is a window in which to report a failure.
  - Saves are debounced (`resize`/`move` fire continuously through a drag) and flushed
    **synchronously** on `close`: that is the only moment guaranteed to see the final state, and an
    awaited write there races the process exit. Published through `renameAtomicSync` with a
    per-call unique temp, like every other store.
  - **NT_MULTI is excluded**: a throwaway dev sandbox may share the real app's userData, and it must
    not move the window of the app being developed.
  - Desktop only, and genuinely so — a browser tab's geometry is the browser's, and the mobile
    companion has no window. Nothing here belongs in `src/core`. **Wayland caveat**: a native-Wayland
    client cannot set its own position (the compositor owns placement), so x/y is honoured under
    XWayland and quietly ignored otherwise. Size and maximized restore either way, which is what the
    drop-don't-clamp rule already degrades to.
- **Window chrome**: macOS integrated title bar (`titleBarStyle: 'hiddenInset'`); the tab
  strip's stationary viewport is the only `no-drag` region for its contents. Explicit regions on
  scrolled descendants escape the overflow clip in Electron's native hit test and subtract from
  the wordmark after scrolling (#847). Keep tab/button/input descendants at the initial `none`;
  the viewport already excludes dragging over them. `scripts/tabbar-drag.test.ts` uses real
  Electron and native XTest input on a disposable Xvfb display (CDP input bypasses this hit test).
  It checks 41 tabs at start/partial/middle/end/back, 28/40/64px heights and both padding modes;
  it does not verify macOS traffic lights, Windows, or movement under a real window manager. The
  bar (`TabBar.tsx`) is the drag region with the `nodeterm` logo + a **Chrome-style tab strip**
  (2026-09-16): inactive tabs are flat and separated by a 1px divider that drops on both sides of a
  hovered or active tab, hover is an inset pill, and the active tab is `--canvas-bg` with rounded
  top corners and two concave flares (`.tab.active::after`, radial gradients) so it merges into the
  surface below — which is also the kanban overlay's colour, so it merges under both views. In
  LIGHT the strip steps back to `--surface-deep` (`--tabbar-bg`), because `--panel` and
  `--canvas-bg` are one value apart there and a canvas-coloured tab would vanish.
  **A tab is as wide as its own NAME and never shrinks** (`max-width: var(--tab-max)` 260px,
  `flex: 0 0 auto`; the name is `flex: 0 1 auto; min-width: 0` with `text-overflow: ellipsis`): the
  strip SCROLLS when the tabs stop fitting, and nothing shortens a name except that cap. This is
  the deliberate departure from Chrome, which shrinks because it must keep every tab reachable
  without scrolling — here the sessions sidebar and ⌘1..9 both reach a project without touching
  the strip, so a readable name is worth more than a visible tab edge.
  **Two earlier rounds tried to ration the name between tabs and both spent the one thing the strip
  is for**, which is why the third does not: #789 gave every tab one flex basis (at 8 tabs / 1340px
  the ACTIVE name measured 24px — zero characters — because it carried the most furniture and hit
  its floor first), and #790 added a 60px floor plus a `tabDensity` level that shed furniture to
  pay for it — whose middle level hid the SSH chip, and 8 tabs in a 1340px window land on exactly
  that level, so every remote tab lost its `SSH` label at the width people work at.
  **`renderer/lib/tabDensity.ts` is deleted**: with full names there is no name budget to protect,
  so there is nothing for a density level to buy. Do not reintroduce one without first saying what
  it is buying. Measured on the third shape (headless Chrome, the real CSS, 86px traffic-light
  reservation): 8 tabs in 1340px — every name whole, every SSH chip present, the strip 14px past
  its width; 12 tabs — every name still whole, the strip scrolling 559px; a 60-character project
  name stops at the 260px cap and is the only thing that ellipsises.
  The fade mask went with the shrinking: a mask gradient is unconditional and would fade the tail
  of a name that fits perfectly, while `text-overflow` is self-conditioning. **The bar's height is ONE number in two places that cannot read each
  other**: `--tabbar-h` in styles.css (every top-anchored panel, the kanban overlay and the usage
  popover position against it) and `TABBAR_HEIGHT_PX` in `@shared/window-chrome-metrics`, from
  which main derives the traffic-light `y` (`trafficLightY`) — a literal 15 for a 44px bar was
  what made shrinking the bar hazardous. It is **40px** (36 for one release, which read as cramped
  once the tabs carried whole names) **by default — the height is a SETTING**
  (`settings.tabBarHeight`, Settings → Appearance, 28–64): `App.tsx` writes the resolved value to
  `--tabbar-h` on `<html>`, and main re-centres the macOS traffic lights on the same settings
  change (`win.setWindowButtonPosition(trafficLightPositionFor(h))`, change-gated), so the two
  cannot disagree. Every reader goes through `resolveTabBarHeight`, which answers the default for
  a non-number and clamps — the floor is what keeps the 12px lights inside the bar. The stylesheet
  token keeps the default LITERAL so an un-hydrated renderer draws the default bar, not none.
  `styles.tabbar.test.ts` pins the token to the constant and
  every dependant to the token. The New-project `+` is a **sibling** of `.tabbar__tabs`, not its last child — inside
  the scroller it vanished once the strip overflowed (no visible scrollbar to hint it was
  still there). The wrapping `.tabbar__projects` is `flex: 1` and stays a drag region (not
  `no-drag`); the pill itself must not be `flex: 1` or it inflates into an empty capsule.
  Cmd+M is intercepted in `main/keydown-intercept.ts` (`before-input-event`, installed from
  `main/index.ts` — else macOS minimizes) and forwarded to the renderer via `app:toggle-markdown`;
  Cmd+W (`app:close-node`) and Cmd+0 (`app:zoom-actual-size`) are taken back the same way. **The
  application menu is OURS**: `buildAppMenu` (`main/index.ts`) calls `Menu.setApplicationMenu` and
  re-runs on every settings change. (This bullet used to claim we never call it — false since that
  function landed; check the template, not Electron's defaults.) **COMMAND-style accelerators are
  handled ABOVE the page on every platform** — Minimize, Close, Toggle Kanban Board, Settings,
  Reload — so a chord one of those owns never reaches the renderer, which is why those three are
  stolen in `before-input-event`. **This is not a blanket claim about the whole menu:** the Edit
  submenu's standard `{role:'cut'|'copy'|'paste'|'selectAll'|…}` items behave differently — Chromium
  routes them into the focused element, so ⌘C in a terminal or a text field does the ordinary thing
  and does not need stealing. Ask which kind an item is before reasoning from this bullet.
  That difference is also why the **stand-down has a menu leg**: while a terminal
  owns the keys under `terminal-first` **or while a shortcut recorder is armed**
  (`menuStandsDown(shortcutRecording, policy, terminalFocused)`), `syncMenuForStandDown` disables
  the command-style items
  named in `menuItemIdsToSuspend` — Minimize (`MENU_ITEM_ID_MINIMIZE`), **Toggle Kanban Board
  (`MENU_ITEM_ID_KANBAN`, ⌘⇧B)** and **Settings (`MENU_ITEM_ID_SETTINGS`, ⌘,)** on every platform,
  plus Close (`MENU_ITEM_ID_CLOSE`) on Windows/Linux — because a disabled item suppresses its
  accelerator and only then do those chords fall through to the terminal, or to the recorder.
  Off-mac the Close item is ALSO disabled whenever a terminal has focus, policy or no policy
  (`closeStandsDownInTerminal`, issue #383): its role owns the Ctrl+W accelerator, and that
  keystroke in a shell is readline's kill-word. The
  recorder leg is why ⌘M is bindable at all, and it fixed a live misfire: ⌘⇧B pressed into an armed
  recorder used to open the kanban board behind the Settings dialog, and ⌘, to re-open Settings.
  Kanban and Settings are
  the ones a reader gets wrong: they are **not** intercepted chords at all but ordinary registry
  commands (`view.kanbanToggle` / `app.settings`), so the renderer's dispatcher could never stand
  them down itself — under app-first the menu takes them before the keydown exists, which is also
  why their capture NOTICE is raised at the IPC receivers in `Canvas.tsx` rather than by the
  dispatcher. **Reload (⌘R / ⌘⇧R) is the named exception and stays live while stood down**: it is
  the crash-recovery lever (a wedged renderer is exactly when it is needed) and a main-frame
  navigation is one of the three sites that reset `terminalFocused` / `shortcutRecording`. **Of the
  items main suspends, Reload is therefore the deliberate exception** — the one it holds back from a
  shortcut recorder — which is what the Keyboard Shortcuts section's description now says.
  **KNOWN GAP, pre-existing and accepted:** the suspend list only ever covered the command-style
  items the terminal-first policy needed, so the always-on app roles — `quit` (⌘Q), `hide` /
  `hideOthers` (⌘H / ⌘⌥H), `toggleDevTools`, `togglefullscreen` — still act while a recorder is
  armed (⌘Q pressed into one QUITS the app). They are deliberately NOT added: ONE list drives both
  stand-downs, and making ⌘Q/⌘H unreachable for a terminal-first user is the worse trade — quit and
  hide must never be policy-gated. Splitting the list per stand-down is the change that would close
  it, and it has not been made.
  `keydown-intercept.test.ts` pins both the stolen chords and the suspended item ids (including
  that the list does not silently grow) — `getMenuItemById` answers `null` for a typo and the
  fail-safe is to do nothing, which is indistinguishable from the feature working.
- **Theme**: macOS dark palette as CSS tokens in `styles.css` `:root` (`--accent` = systemBlue,
  label/separator opacities, SF font stack). Canvas background is black with dot grid.

## Idle energy: an animation is a frame loop, not a decoration

**A running CSS animation obliges the compositor to produce a frame every vsync — on a ProMotion
display 120 of them a second — for as long as it runs, and each of those frames re-rasters and
re-composites the whole window.** That cost is paid once for the WINDOW, not once per animation, and
it does not care whether anybody is looking: an unfocused window that is still visible (a second
monitor, half behind an editor) is not `document.hidden` by any definition Chromium uses, so it
keeps producing frames at full display rate.

MEASURED on the Server Edition, 40 terminal nodes on one canvas, headless Chrome, 25 s idle windows,
total CPU across every Chrome process (`/proc/<pid>/stat`):

| state | CPU |
|---|---|
| idle, nothing animating | **1.5 %** |
| **one** visible node with the `working` glow | **33 %** |
| five | 66 % |
| twenty | 101 % |
| twenty, but all panned OFF screen | 2.2 % |
| twenty, under an opaque full-screen overlay | 12.8 % |
| twenty, `animation-play-state: paused` | **1.6 %** |
| twenty, `animation: none` + a static opacity | 1.9 % |
| first-run mobile-launch card open (5 animations, no node glows) | 97 % |

Four things to take from that table, because each one contradicts a reasonable guess:

- **The step is at the FIRST animation, not the twentieth.** What costs is that frames are produced
  at all. So a gate that covers most of the app's animations buys nothing — one that keeps running
  holds the frame loop open, while everything the gate DOES cover still looks correctly frozen. That
  is why `--nt-anim-state` is applied to EVERY `infinite` animation in `styles.css` and enforced by
  scan (`styles.animation-gate.test.ts`) rather than applied to the worst few by hand.
- **Offscreen nodes are already free** (2.2 %): Chromium skips raster and compositing for layers
  fully outside the viewport. There is nothing to fix there, and a viewport-gated animation would be
  work with no measurable return. A canvas of 119 nodes costs what its VISIBLE animated nodes cost.
- **`paused` is as cheap as `none`** (1.6 % vs 1.9 %), so the gate freezes each animation where it
  stands instead of snapping it to a resting frame — nothing MOVES at the moment focus is lost, and
  refocusing resumes rather than restarts.
- **The renderer's MAIN thread is idle throughout.** Over the 25 s window with one node pulsing,
  `Performance.getMetrics` reported 0.15 s of `TaskDuration`, 1 layout and 51 style recalcs, while
  the renderer PROCESS burned 14.8 % and the GPU process 17.9 %. This is compositor and raster work,
  invisible to every JS-level profiler and to a timer census.

**What the numbers are NOT.** Headless Chrome here rasters in software (SwiftShader), so the
absolute percentages are inflated relative to a real GPU and none of them is a prediction about
macOS. What the A/B establishes is the MECHANISM and its direction; the magnitude on a given machine
has to be measured there (`powermetrics --samplers gpu_power,tasks`, and Activity Monitor's Energy
Impact, which weights GPU use and wakeups heavily).

**Timers are not the problem, and the census that said so is worth not repeating.** Over the same
idle window the renderer fired **56 timer callbacks in 30 s** (~1.9/s: 40 per-node liveness polls at
1/30 Hz, the 2 s terminal-focus mirror, the 30 s host-RAM read) and **zero** `requestAnimationFrame`
callbacks — the default renderer path has no self-perpetuating rAF loop (glyphgrid's parks after 30
idle frames and is opt-in; the dino game's is focus-gated). Before adding a timer gate for energy
reasons, measure: at these frequencies a JS wakeup is nothing beside one frame of compositing.

**The board is the second gate, and it is a SEPARATE attribute on purpose.** The canvas stays
mounted under the kanban overlay (`display: none` would 0x0-resize every terminal into a tmux
SIGWINCH), so its glows and pulses keep animating under something nobody can see through — 12.8 %
in the table above. `renderer/lib/canvasCovered.ts` marks `data-nt-canvas="covered"` for as long as
a full-page board view is MOUNTED (mount is the signal: both board views are conditionally
rendered, so it cannot drift from the view state the way a recomputed `kanbanOpen` flag can, and it
needs nothing from Canvas), and `:root[data-nt-canvas='covered'] .react-flow` overrides
`--nt-anim-state` on that subtree alone — the variable INHERITS, so that one declaration is the
whole gate for every animation reading it. It is not a second writer of `data-nt-window` because
the two facts are independent (a board on a focused window; an unfocused window with no board) and
one attribute with two owners is a race over who clears it. The claim is refcounted: React can
mount the incoming view before unmounting the outgoing one, and a plain set/clear pair would let
that unmount erase the live view's claim.

**Specificity is the quiet failure mode in all of this, and it has already happened twice.** The
three glows carry their own `animation:` shorthand, which RESETS `animation-play-state` — so
inheriting the variable does nothing for them and every gate has to name them explicitly. A first
draft of the covered rule used `.react-flow__node::after`, lost to
`.react-flow__node:has(.term-node.working)::after` on specificity, and measured EXACTLY the
unpatched number while looking correct in the diff. When you add a gate, verify the COMPUTED
`animation-play-state` on a real element, not the presence of the declaration.

The gate itself: `renderer/lib/windowActivity.ts` sets `data-nt-window="idle"` on the document
element when the window loses focus or the page hides, `:root[data-nt-window='idle']` flips
`--nt-anim-state` to `paused`, and the three per-node glows take a static-lit rule instead of the
shared pause — `nt-unread-glow` rests at `opacity: 0`, so pausing it is a coin flip on whether the
glow that says "this agent finished while you were away" is still on screen when you come back to
look for it. `hud.css` is deliberately excluded: the notch HUD's window is never focused, so the
shared gate would freeze it permanently rather than while nobody is looking.

**The working glow is BOUNDED; the unread and attention glows are not.** The idle gate only helps an
unfocused window, and an agent mid-turn in a FOCUSED one kept `nt-working-glow` looping for the
whole turn — MEASURED (production build, M2, focused): one visible working node cost **+3 points
total CPU and ~25 style recalcs/s** for as long as it ran. It now runs 4 cycles of 2.6 s (~10 s) and
rests at `opacity: 0.7`, the same static-lit value the idle gate and Reduce Motion already hold it
at; the keyframes start and end at 0.7, so the settle is seamless. A new turn re-adds `.working`,
which restarts the pulse — and so does anything else that re-applies the animation: a window
refocus (the idle gate sets `animation: none`, so lifting it starts the shorthand afresh) and a node
remount (a project switch, a park re-adopt) each replay the four pulses. Still bounded every time. Unread and attention stay infinite on purpose — they exist to pull the
eye, and the idle gate covers the unfocused case. `styles.animation-gate.test.ts` pins the bounded
shorthand, the resting opacity and the keyframe endpoints.

**A camera move freezes the viewport's raster scale, and only for the move.** `onCanvasMoveStart`
adds `canvas-camera-moving` to the flow wrapper in EVERY appearance (before the glass-only
early-return — it is not a glass feature), and `.canvas-camera-moving .react-flow__viewport` sets
`will-change: transform`, so the compositor scales the already-rastered layer instead of
re-rasterising every node's DOM at each intermediate zoom. MEASURED (12 WebGL terminals, 60 Hz
synthetic wheel zoom, M2, production build): **41–48% → 30–36%** total CPU, GPU process **22% →
15%**. It MUST stay transient: `onCanvasMoveEnd` removes the class 150 ms after the move settles so
text re-rasters sharp at the final scale — a permanent `will-change` on the viewport leaves every
terminal blurry after a zoom. `canvas/camera-moving.test.ts` pins both halves (the rule is scoped
to the class, and no bare `.react-flow__viewport` rule carries `will-change`).

## Remote access (phone relay) — free, not Pro

- Phone relay remote access ("Reach this Mac from anywhere") is a **Core (free) feature** as of
  2026-08-01 — the iOS app is itself paid, so a desktop Pro gate double-charged the same feature.
  The former Pro gate AND the free-tier monthly quota (`core/relay-quota.ts`, `RelayQuotaBanner`,
  the ProCompare meter, the `relayQuota` IPC/preload/bridge surface, docs/relay-quota.md) were all
  **removed**. The toggle (`settings.phoneAccessEnabled`, Settings → Phone + quick-pair popover)
  shows for everyone; the standing host reconciles on `enabled && relayAllowed()` alone, with no
  quota metering at `onPeerReady`. **Entitlement passthrough remains**: a stored Pro entitlement is
  sent on mints, else the `{deviceId,…}` body (host-token `{deviceId, hostPublicKeyB64}`, device
  mint `{deviceId, hostDeviceId, hostPublicKeyB64, label}`). **The backend is the real gate now**:
  `POST /v1/relay/host-token` / `/v1/relay/device` must admit deviceId (no-entitlement) mints, and
  the relay server may rate-limit free hosts independently — a client-side gate must NOT be
  reintroduced to work around a backend refusal (fix the backend policy instead).
- **A Windows desktop pairs relay-only — no SSH key, and do not "fix" that by writing one.** The
  phone's direct-SSH path is POSIX sh + tmux end to end (nodeterm-ios `HostCommands`, `TmuxBinary`,
  the typed `tmux new-session -A` attach, workspace paths with no `%APPDATA%` candidate). Windows
  OpenSSH hands out `cmd.exe`, and sessions live in the session host, which nothing on the phone
  can attach to over SSH. So on win32 `createPairingService` installs no key, the QR carries
  `"ssh":false`, the QR is gated on the RELAY instead of sshd (`shared/pairing-gate.ts`), and a
  failed relay mint pairs NOTHING (502 to the phone, `reason:'relay-failed'` to the UI) instead of
  the SSH platforms' LAN-only degrade. **A key sshd accepts makes things worse, not better**: the
  phone tries SSH before the relay, so a working key pins it to a path that cannot work, where a
  rejected one lets it fall through. Issue #758's `administrators_authorized_keys` rule is detected
  (`main/windows-ssh-keys.ts`) only to explain the missing key; revoke still sweeps that file IN
  PLACE (a temp + rename would swap its Administrators+SYSTEM ACL for the directory's, and sshd
  would then refuse every admin key in it). Relay attach on Windows rests on the session host
  being packaged (#575, shipped by #579): without that bundle `pty.attach` spawns a new plain shell
  instead of joining the node's session, while `sessionExists` still answers "warm".

## Speech / dictation (desktop + server)

Voice-to-text input captured via microphone, turned into terminal text via on-device Whisper. Works on desktop (Electron) and Server Edition (browser); iOS support is separate (`nodeterm-ios`, private — see the three-surfaces entry under Conventions).

- **Service seam** (`src/core/speech/`) — `SpeechService` (core) + `PlatformSpeechProvider` interface + shell implementations (`PlatformElectron` / `PlatformServer`). Models are stored under `${dataDir}/speech-models/`, with fenced downloads + orphan sweep (`removeUnusedModels`). Core validates license: **tiny** free (always); **base·small·large-v3-turbo** Pro (via `isPremium()`). One model loaded at a time (FIFO memory management), lazy smart-whisper import degrades to a friendly error if the native dep is unavailable (`"Local whisper is unavailable…"`).
- **Cloud contract (iOS parity)** — `/v1/transcribe` multipart endpoint (not built yet; SDK `transcribe()` call matches iOS byte-for-byte) for future remote transcription. IPC channels `speech:*` (in `src/shared/ipc.ts`) wired in **both** Electron and Server: `speech:transcribe` (returns `Promise<{text}>`), `speech:models`, `speech:model-download`, `speech:model-delete`, `speech:progress` (main/server → renderer download-progress broadcast), and `speech:mic-consent` (Electron mic-prompt only, server always true). There is no `speech:synthesize` / `speech:cancel` and no audio in the reply.
- **Renderer capture** — `PcmCapture` AudioWorklet (16kHz single-channel PCM, WebAudio or fallback SPN) + DictationOverlay (⌘⇧D dock mic / Cmd key; Settings → Speech section for model choice + progress). **Send** appends text + Enter to the terminal; **Insert** sends text-only via `sendText(…, {enter: false})`. **Nothing auto-submits** (user always decides when to send).
- **Language** — `SPEECH_LANGUAGES` (`src/shared/speech.ts`) is whisper's own `LANGUAGES` table
  (tokenizer.py) verbatim: 100 entries carrying the code, CLDR's English name, the endonym and the
  alternate spellings people type (whisper's own name where it differs, plus its documented alias
  table); Cantonese is flagged `sinceV3`, the one entry the pre-large-v3 models have no token for.
  It replaced a **7-entry array inside `SpeechSection`** which was the ONLY limit in the whole
  stack (issue #586): `SpeechSettings.language` is a free string nothing validates on the way to
  disk and whisper.cpp takes any code, so `"language": "pl"` hand-edited into settings.json
  transcribed Polish correctly while the dropdown rendered **blank** and overwrote it on the next
  click in the row. Three rules come out of that:
  - The control is the app's **searchable menu idiom** (`SpeechLanguageSelect` — `.bind-select`
    trigger + portaled `.tab-menu` with a pinned filter over a scrolling list, the Source Control
    branch quick-pick's shape), never a `<select>`: 101 rows with no search, unreachable by typing
    "polski", is not a picker. Rows are the pure `renderer/lib/speechLanguageRows.ts`.
  - **A code we cannot name is still the user's setting.** `speechLanguageLabel` returns an unknown
    code AS-IS (not `''`) and the picker gives it its own row, so a display gap can never become
    data loss the way the `<select>` made it.
  - **The cloud `locale` is passed through unchanged, `auto` included.** `register-ipc.ts` used to
    send `language === 'auto' ? 'en' : language`, so on the Cloud engine "Auto-detect" was a hard,
    silent English — on the one engine where a missing language could not be worked around at all.
    `/v1/transcribe` does not exist yet, so `auto` = detect is our contract to write.
  Deliberately NOT done here: seeding the initial value from the system locale (issue #586 §3) —
  the default is still `auto`. **Mobile** keeps its own list, tracked separately as issue #591.
- **Browser constraints** — `getUserMedia` requires HTTPS or `localhost`; mic permission prompt is the browser's own (not handled by nodeterm). Model downloads land on the **server's data dir** (accessible across sessions).
- **Electron + native dep** — smart-whisper is externalized + `asarUnpack`'d (not bundled); `postinstall` rebuilds it against Electron's ABI. Device verification of the ABI rebuild is not yet exercised on a dev machine — test paths exist but have not been run in CI.

## Packaging & auto-update

Built with **electron-builder** (config in the `package.json` `build` block: appId
`com.nodeterm.app`, productName `nodeterm`, mac dmg+zip for arm64 **and** x64, `asarUnpack`
node-pty, output `dist/`). The app icon is generated from the nodeterm mark by
`scripts/make-icon.mjs` (sharp → `build/icon.png` 1024² + multi-resolution `build/icon.ico`
for Windows, both gitignored — regenerated by `make-icon`, which every dist script runs first);
the same script hand-packs `build/icon.icns` (size-checked frames — issue #369) and `build/icon.ico`, which electron-builder embeds as-is. Scripts: `npm run make-icon`, `npm run dist`
(local **unsigned** arm64 `.dmg` smoke test), `npm run dist:win` (unsigned x64 NSIS installer +
zip, `--publish never`). Production release signing/notarization and the update-feed hosting are
handled outside this repo.

**Linux ships AppImage + deb + rpm**, all unsigned, all built by `release-linux` on a plain
`ubuntu-latest` runner (`npm run dist:linux` locally). Three things about it are easy to get wrong:

- **The packages are named `node-terminal`, the AppImage is named `nodeterm`.** electron-builder's
  `linuxPackageName` is package.json's `name`, not `productName` (it only falls back to the product
  name for an `@scope/…` name), so the artifacts are `node-terminal_<version>_amd64.deb`,
  `node-terminal-<version>.x86_64.rpm` and `nodeterm-<version>.AppImage`, the launcher is
  `/usr/bin/node-terminal`, and the install prefix is `/opt/nodeterm` (that one IS the productName).
  Anything that matches on the package name (`scripts/uninstall.sh`'s `dpkg -s` / `rpm -q` probes,
  the README's install lines) must say `node-terminal` or it silently never fires. Renaming the
  package to match the app would strand existing `.deb` installs on a package apt no longer tracks,
  which is why the mismatch is documented rather than fixed.
- **The rpm target shells out to the system `rpmbuild`.** electron-builder bundles fpm, but not
  rpmbuild, so `release-linux` installs it explicitly (`apt-get install -y rpm`); without it the
  target dies with "Need executable 'rpmbuild' to convert dir to rpm". The default `Requires` set
  electron-builder emits (gtk3, libnotify, nss, libXScrnSaver, `(libXtst or libXtst6)`, xdg-utils,
  at-spi2-core, `(libuuid or libuuid1)`) resolves on Fedora 44 with nothing extra pulled in;
  verified by installing the built rpm, which also proved rpm 6.0.2 accepts fpm's spec.
- **Auto-update is already correct for rpm and needs no work**: `isManualUpdatePlatform`
  (src/shared/update-platform.ts) keys off the absence of `APPIMAGE` in the environment, so a deb
  and an rpm install both land on the manual-download card rather than downloading an AppImage
  they cannot install.
- **The ORDER of `build.linux.target` is load-bearing: AppImage stays FIRST.** electron-builder
  writes the update feed from the first target it can publish, so the entry at the head of that
  array is what `latest-linux.yml` points at — and the AppImage is the only Linux artifact
  electron-updater can actually install in place. `deb` has sat behind it for a long time without
  disturbing the feed, and `rpm` is appended behind both for the same reason. package.json is JSON
  and cannot carry the comment, so it is written here: **do not alphabetize or otherwise re-sort
  that array.**

**Building on a GCC 14+ distro needs `CFLAGS=-D_GNU_SOURCE`** (Fedora, Arch, recent openSUSE; the
CI runners are old enough not to care). smart-whisper's vendored `whisper.cpp/ggml/src/ggml.c`
calls `CPU_ZERO`, `CPU_SET_S`, `pthread_getaffinity_np` and `getcpu` without ever defining
`_GNU_SOURCE` (upstream ggml gets it from its CMake build, which node-gyp does not use), and GCC 14
promoted implicit function declarations from a warning to an error, so a bare `npm install` fails
in smart-whisper's own install script before our `postinstall` ever runs. Measured on Fedora 44 /
GCC 16.2.1: `CFLAGS=-D_GNU_SOURCE npm install` builds both native modules clean. Two Fedora runtime
packages are needed on top: **`libxcrypt-compat`** (fpm's bundled Ruby links `libcrypt.so.1`, which
Fedora's glibc dropped, and without it BOTH the deb and the rpm target fail), and **`fuse-libs`**
for anyone running the AppImage, whose default runtime is still the FUSE2 one. Switching
`build.toolsets.appimage` to `"1.0.3"` would drop that FUSE2 requirement, but the static runtime is
upstream-flagged beta and stops passing the `--no-sandbox` launcher argument the FUSE2 path adds,
so it is a deliberate not-yet.

**Windows ships as an UNSIGNED BETA** (extracted from external PR #276; the session-host phase
#305 merged 2026-08-20, and the decision to release without signing is #454 — CI-green, but no
real-device daily-use verification yet, and that is a stated risk, not an oversight). Deliberate
decisions: the target
is **NSIS via electron-builder** — the fork switched to Squirrel.Windows
(`electron-builder-squirrel-windows` + an 800-line `windows-installer.mjs` wrapper + its own
update feed), but our pipeline is electron-builder end-to-end and NSIS is built in, needs no
extra dependency, and is what electron-updater's generic provider expects on Windows — so
Squirrel was not adopted. Builds are **unsigned** (no Windows cert; electron-builder skips
signing when no cert env is present; SmartScreen warns on install). Release wiring is
`release.yml`'s `release-win` job: on every version tag it uploads the NSIS installer + zip as
GitHub Release assets — **best-effort by design** (the `publish` promote gate does not wait on
it, so a Windows failure never strands the mac+linux release) and with **no update-feed leg**:
`dist:win` stamps `nodeTermUpdates=disabled`, so the shipped app's updater is cleanly off (no
latest.yml anywhere, no 404 polling; users update by downloading the next installer). Do not
add `*.yml`/`*.blockmap` to that job's upload globs — that IS the auto-update leg, and it waits
on signing. `bootstrap-windows.bat` (repo root) takes a fresh Windows
machine to a built checkout: it verifies Node ≥ 20 / VS Build Tools C++ / Python 3 with exact
winget hints (it never installs machine-wide tools itself, and the full bootstrap refuses to run
elevated) and runs `npm ci`. Its `--check-vs-build-tools` mode is the narrow exception used by
`quality-windows`: it branches before the elevation refusal, runs only the VS C++ probe, and exits
before the Node / Python / `npm ci` steps. Fixture injection additionally requires the explicit
`NODETERM_BOOTSTRAP_TESTING=1` sentinel. The C++ probe also verifies the x64 Spectre runtime that
`node-pty`'s `/Qspectre` build requires; the workload alone can be present while that optional
component is absent, which otherwise fails only after the full install with `MSB8040`. Before
`npm ci`, the bootstrap sets `npm_config_enable_thin_lto=false` and
`npm_config_enable_lto=false`: official Node 26 Windows builds carry clang/lld ThinLTO settings in
`process.config`, and node-gyp 12 copies them into an MSVC addon project where `link.exe` rejects
`/opt:lldltojobs` with `LNK1117`. These are gyp overrides, not a reason to reject a Node version
allowed by `package.json`. `.github/workflows/win-package-smoke.yml` is a
**workflow_dispatch-only** packaging smoke on windows-latest — build only, never publishes.
Windows installer safety (#829): `build/installer.nsh` overrides NSIS's process-killing check.
A running app or session host blocks install/uninstall, and a failed process query blocks too.
Never restore automatic host termination: quitting the app preserves those live sessions.
Update preparation must keep saved canvas nodes: exit programs normally, quit, then have the user
verify and stop any remaining host. Never recommend **End session** (it deletes nodes). Cold agent
resume depends on supported, saved conversation history; it does not preserve running tasks.
See `docs/windows-session-host.md` for the user-controlled preparation/recovery steps and limits.

**Follow-ups, in order:** code signing, then Windows auto-update wiring (electron-updater NSIS leg
+ `latest.yml` on the nodeterm.dev feed — blocked on signing: an unsigned auto-update is a
downgrade in trust), and the fork's PE-identity polish (electron-builder leaves `OriginalFilename`
empty; the fork's
`resedit`-based afterSign hook fixes it — cosmetic for NSIS, load-bearing only for Squirrel).

**macOS permission prompts are declared in `build.mac.extendInfo`, and a missing one denies
SILENTLY.** On macOS 15+ a connection to the user's own subnet is gated by Local Network privacy,
and it is attributed to the **responsible process** — for everything nodeterm spawns (the tmux
server, the shell, an agent CLI, the `node` it runs) that is nodeterm.app, not the child. With no
`NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription` there is no string to prompt with, so the system never asks and
**no row appears** under System Settings → Privacy & Security → Local Network for the user to
grant: an agent gets `EHOSTUNREACH` on a LAN address while `/usr/bin/curl` (Apple-signed, exempt)
reaches the same host in the same second — a permission failure wearing a network outage's error
(issue #589). `NSBonjourServices` is the trap that travels with it: it is required only to *browse*
mDNS services, which this app does not do, and declaring service types we never browse is a false
claim to the user and to review — unicast LAN access needs the usage description alone. The key is
what makes the denial grantable; it is not itself proof anyone's access came back. Guarded as an
allowlist-with-reasons by `src/main/info-plist.test.ts`, the sibling of the entitlements guard.

Auto-update uses **electron-updater** (`src/main/updater.ts`, `initUpdater(onBeforeRestart?)` from `index.ts`):
runs **only when `app.isPackaged`** (dev = no-op), checks on launch + every 6h, auto-downloads,
forwards the lifecycle (`update-available` / `download-progress` / `update-downloaded` / errors)
to the renderer over IPC. `components/UpdateCard.tsx` shows the strip + **Restart to update** →
`updates.restart()` → `autoUpdater.quitAndInstall()`; on `update-downloaded` an OS notification
also fires when the window is unfocused. Exposed via `window.nodeTerminal.updates` (`UpdateApi`).
macOS *silent* self-install requires a signed+notarized build; unsigned builds still surface
the card for a manual download.

**Backend check feed** (`src/core/check.ts`, successor to the static `announcements.json`): the
**main process** calls `GET https://api.nodeterm.dev/v1/check?version=&os=&channel=stable` (so the
renderer CSP stays `'self'`) on launch + every 6h, cached 5 min, returning `{ messages, update }`.
Exposed split over two IPC handlers: `announcements.fetch()` → `messages`, `appUpdatePolicy` →
`update`. `components/AnnouncementBanner.tsx` (stacked above `UpdateCard` under the tab bar in a
`.top-banners` column) shows the newest message the user hasn't dismissed (dismissed `id`s persist
in `localStorage`); `update.mandatory`/`minSupported` flips `UpdateCard` into a blocking required-
update state. The call no-ops under `DO_NOT_TRACK`/`NODETERM_TELEMETRY_DISABLED` or in unpackaged
builds (unless `NODETERM_API_BASE` targets a local server). Schema example:
`docs/announcements.example.json`. **Telemetry** (`src/main/telemetry.ts`) is a separate opt-out
ping to `api.nodeterm.dev/v1/ping` (version/OS on launch + daily), gated on
`settings.telemetryEnabled` + the same build/DNT guards; toggle in Settings → Privacy.

## Atomic writes (never a bare `fs.rename`)

Every store persists temp-file-then-rename. That is correct on POSIX and **silently lossy on
Windows**: `MoveFileEx` fails with `EPERM` whenever the destination is open by anyone at that
instant, and what opens a file you just wrote is Defender's real-time scanner, the search indexer,
OneDrive over a synced profile, or two of our own concurrent writers racing one destination. The
save throws and the data is gone — intermittently, unreproducibly, and **more often on the machines
that are best protected**.

`renameAtomic` / `writeFileAtomic` (`src/core/fs-atomic.ts`) retry briefly. Each attempt is still
one indivisible rename, so a retry cannot tear a write. They deliberately do NOT retry forever
(several callers report a failed save as `persisted:false`, and that contract outranks a save that
eventually lands), do not retry `ENOENT`/`ENOSPC`, do not branch on platform (or the behaviour under
test on a Mac is not the behaviour shipped to Windows), and never swallow the final error.

**Nothing in the toolchain catches the bare version.** 28 files had it, across three spellings — the user's canvas, their
settings, their sealed credentials, their pinned devices — and every one of them reads as a correct
atomic write, because on the platform most of this was written on it is one. The only signal in a
6,000-test suite was one store's overlapping-saves test, red on Windows for that store's whole life.
So it is enforced by scan: `src/core/fs-atomic.guard.test.ts` fails on any bare `fs.rename` outside
the helper. Full write-up, including the separate shared-temp-name bug at the same sites:
**`docs/atomic-writes.md`**.

SSH/scp staging follows the same ownership rule outside direct `fs` calls. Atomic remote stdin
writes use `src/main/remote-atomic-write.ts`: a bounded `.nodeterm-<uuid>.tmp` leaf is placed beside
the target BEFORE both complete paths are quoted, then the shell preserves the write/move status
while cleaning that exact temp. The temp leaf must stay independent of the target leaf — appending
`.uuid.tmp` to a valid `NAME_MAX` target makes the write impossible. It currently protects
filesystem API writes, tmux.conf, the private hook endpoint, node
tokens, agent status and pending answers; some generated hook scripts/config merges still use direct writes; only the guarded shared
Claude/Gemini settings transactions stage and rename here. Do not generalize that claim to every installer. Upload directories use UUIDs across app
processes. Downloads and media-cache copies use hidden UUID `.part` names; user-visible downloads
also hold an exclusive candidate lock until the rename and cleanup finish. Never simplify any of
those back to `<target>.tmp` / `<target>.part` or a read-only "does the destination exist?" check —
the overlap tests exercise the resulting race.

## The test suite never touches a live tmux server

This repo is developed from inside nodeterm, so `tmux -L node-terminal` and `-L nodeterm-rmt` are
not fixture names on a contributor's machine — they are the servers holding every terminal they have
open. A test that binds one shares a process with the user's whole canvas, and the failure mode is
not a red test: it is every pane printing `[server exited unexpectedly]` (issue #629).

**Every vitest run gets a private `TMUX_TMPDIR`.** tmux resolves `-L <socket>` to
`$TMUX_TMPDIR/tmux-<uid>/<socket>` and falls back to `/tmp` when the variable is unset, so
re-pointing the variable re-points every socket name at once — including the real ones, including
in a suite nobody thought about. `test/setup/tmux-sandbox.ts` (`globalSetup`) creates the directory,
kills whatever is still bound inside it and removes it; `test/setup/tmux-worker-env.ts`
(`setupFiles`) re-asserts it inside each worker and **refuses to run** if it is missing, because
vitest's env inheritance into workers is an implementation detail and a silent fallback would put
every test back on the live server. `enterSandbox` also strips `TMUX`/`TMUX_PANE` — a suite run from
inside a nodeterm terminal inherits a live client's, and production strips both for the same reason.

Two suites deliberately name a real socket, and both are allowlisted with their reason in
`src/core/tmux-socket-isolation.guard.test.ts`: `agents/pane-owner.test.ts` (the production bytes
hardcode `-L nodeterm-rmt`; re-spelling it would judge different bytes) and
`main/remote/host-destroy-tmux.test.ts` (`PtyManager` binds `TMUX_SOCKET` itself). The latter was
the one file that reached the live server by construction — measured, not inferred — and it now
refuses to start unless the sandbox is in effect.

**What the sandbox does NOT do:** two suites naming the same socket inside it still share one tmux
server, so a `kill-server` there is still a shared-server kill — it has just been moved somewhere
harmless. Measured on CI the day this landed: the guard test's own `kill-server` on
`node-terminal` ended `host-destroy-tmux.test.ts`'s session mid-assertion. A suite kills its OWN
sessions by exact target (`-t =<name>`, since a miss falls through to prefix matching), or it owns
a socket name nothing else uses.

The guard has three legs on purpose, and the weakest one is the scan: a test can still escape by
handing a real tmux an `env` object it built from scratch with no `TMUX_TMPDIR` in it, which no
regex sees. So the structural leg is the sandbox, the behavioural leg actually **starts a server on
the real socket name and proves the socket file landed inside the sandbox** (asserting the env var
would only prove we set a variable — the resolution rule is a property of tmux), and the scan exists
to make a third allowlist entry a decision somebody signs for. Same shape as the `fs.rename` guard,
for the same reason: nobody reading one file can see this.

**What this does not claim.** #629's server death was not traced to a test — the reporter's evidence
points at tmux's `server_accept()` calling `fatal()` under the suite's process/fd burst on a
memory-starved machine, and two identical runs finished clean. Sharing a server with the user's live
sessions is a hazard whatever kills it; this removes the hazard, not a proven cause.

## Conventions

- **Two docs, two audiences — keep both.** This file holds the deep invariants with their
  reasoning and measurements; it is dense on purpose and is loaded automatically by coding agents.
  **`CONTRIBUTING.md` is the short human door**: setup, the process-boundary rules, the house rules
  that get a PR sent back, and the testing habits. When you change or discover something **other
  developers must know before touching the code** — a boundary that is now enforced, a trap that
  costs an hour to diagnose, a habit that catches a class of bug — **add it to `CONTRIBUTING.md`
  too, not only here.** An invariant that lives only in this file (or worse, only in a commit
  message) is one refactor away from being violated by a contributor who never opened it. Keep the
  split by audience, not by topic: the *why it must be this way* stays here, the *what you need to
  know before your first PR* goes there.


- Code comments, UI strings, and identifiers are all in **English**. Match this when editing.
- **The local machine is not a Mac.** Every user-visible string naming it goes through
  `renderer/lib/machineName.ts` (`thisMachine()` / `thisMachineCap()` / `machineNoun()` →
  "this Mac" / "this PC" / "this computer"). A **browser tab always gets the neutral word**: the
  license, seats and sessions it describes belong to the SERVER, and the viewer's `navigator` says
  nothing about that machine's OS — a confident wrong noun is worse than a plain one. Issue #563
  found ~30 such strings, and the damage was not in Accounts but in the copy people must TRUST:
  "This Mac is not authorized on this license" and "a teammate on a seat can run commands on this
  Mac". `machineName.guard.test.ts` scans non-comment lines in `src/renderer` + `src/shared` and
  fails on a new one, with a named-and-reasoned exemption list (the ptmx-limit banner, whose
  `kern.tty.ptmx_max` really is macOS; the onboarding notch step, which only exists there).
  `@shared` code cannot ask the renderer, so it takes the machine word as a PARAMETER defaulting
  to the neutral one (`describeGrant(peer, machine)`) rather than hard-coding a brand.
- Path aliases: `@shared/*`, `@renderer/*` (see the tsconfig files / vite config).
- **Subagent model:** when dispatching subagents (implementers, reviewers, etc. — e.g. in
  the subagent-driven-development workflow), use the latest model, **Opus 5**
  (`claude-opus-5`). This overrides any cheaper-model defaults in a skill's model-selection
  guidance.
- **Three surfaces — design every feature for all of them.** nodeterm now ships on three
  fronts, and a feature is not "done" until you've decided how it behaves on each (even if
  the decision is "not applicable here"):
  1. **Desktop** (Electron) — the primary app (`src/main` + `src/renderer` via the preload).
  2. **Server Edition** (Linux, browser) — `src/server` + the `src/renderer/bridge` shim (see
     the `src/server/` bullet above and docs/SERVER.md).
  3. **Mobile companion** — *nodeterm mobile*, a **separate PRIVATE repo** (`nodeterm-ios`)
     — outside contributors cannot see or PR it, so a mobile implication is raised in the
     desktop PR and **@eneskirca** is mentioned to carry it over
     (SwiftUI + SwiftTerm/Citadel, tmux-integrated, talks the `TerminalTransport`/RemoteTransport
     protocol).

  **The canvas and the kanban board are TWO VIEWS of the same nodes — treat the board as a
  first-class surface, not an afterthought.** Every session/node feature you add to a canvas node
  (a header action, a context-menu item, a status badge, file drop, dictation, …) should be
  considered for the kanban **card** and its **card modal** too, so we don't keep shipping a
  feature on one view and then bolting it onto the other in a follow-up. The board already mirrors
  most of the node's surface: the card modal co-attaches the same tmux session (`ModalTerminal`),
  carries the node's actions (search / dictate / AI-name / comments), accepts file drops
  (`terminal/file-drop.ts`), renders browser webviews (`BrowserSurface`), and its cards support
  right-click actions + `+ New`. When you touch a node's UI, ask "does the board need this too?"
  and wire it through `KanbanView`/`SessionCard`/`CardModal` in the SAME change. Kanban itself is
  desktop+Server-Edition (pure renderer + `workspace.save`); the iOS board is a separate read/move
  mirror (`nodeterm-ios`, `KanbanGrouping`/`ProjectBoardView`).

  Practical rules that keep the surfaces in sync:
  - **Put new service/main-process logic in `src/core` behind `CorePlatform`, never inline in
    `src/main`.** That is the seam the Server Edition boots from — logic left in `src/main`
    silently doesn't exist on the server (the `no-electron` tests enforce the boundary, but
    they can't tell you a feature is *missing* server-side).
  - **A feature that touches `window.nodeTerminal` needs a real `src/renderer/bridge`
    implementation, not just a stub** — or a deliberate, documented graceful degrade
    (`E_UNSUPPORTED` + the affordance hidden, like the Electron-only `shell.reveal`). The
    bridge's `satisfies NodeTerminalApi` gate forces you to *declare* every member, but a
    `noopUnsub`/`unsupported` stub compiles fine while doing nothing — decide per member.
  - **Consider whether the mobile companion should surface the feature** over its
    transport/protocol. It's a different repo and stack (Swift), so this is usually a
    follow-up note rather than same-PR work — but flag it so it isn't forgotten.
  When a change is genuinely desktop-only (native menus, auto-update, Keychain), say so; the
  point is to make the call consciously, not to leave the other surfaces to rot.

An unanswered Claude `AskUserQuestion` is correlated by session and tool-use ID in the core
mirror, independently of its short-lived display stash. Ordinary hooks, subagent activity and
unrelated transcript results must not clear attention or archive its inbox card. Both shells
use `recordQuestionResult` for transcript rescue (including Escape/decline), and broadcast the
mirror's effective event. Keep result IDs through local and SSH tails; a boolean “some tool
finished” is insufficient. Explicit new user turns, interrupts and session boundaries reset it.

Claude child `PreToolUse`/`PostToolUse`/`PostToolUseFailure` hooks must not drive parent state.
Child `PermissionRequest` and attention `Notification` hooks still reach needs-you and phone
approvals, including the raw approval summary and deterministic reply ticket. Keep raw summary
recording before the child transcript-association guard in both shells.

A held parent question can overlap child permissions: retain its question card and waiting
state while publishing each approval ticket separately. Approval replies resolve only their
own ticket; the picker stays pending until its correlated answer or explicit reset.
When the parent answers first, retain concurrent approval tickets and blocked attention until
their own replies; ordinary tool activity cannot settle them. Explicit turn/session resets
still cancel both kinds of pending attention.

Held approval attention must not replace subagent, recurring or background-task events, or refresh
state evidence from those lifecycle hooks. A parent may ask several questions while a child ticket
is outstanding: track each new picker and preserve child approval cards independently, including
when their display titles match. Answering either resolves only that question or ticket.

Remote Codex safety (#736): `spawnNew` requires managed SSH Codex accounts (including custom
Codex harnesses and known agent-less login terminals) to have a safe id in the saved Codex account
list and a safe resolved `remoteHome`. `remoteAccountScopeEnvArgs` then supplies the private
`CODEX_HOME` and account marker. An unresolved or unsafe home must refuse before env staging/spawn,
not fall back to the host's system login. System Codex retains the host environment even before
home discovery during early attach. Never guess HOME/CODEX_HOME. Desktop and Server share this
core gate; Desktop supports the remote lifecycle, while Server account management remains unavailable.

## Media playback lifetime (#680)

Audio routes through `isMediaFile` to the existing persisted `video` kind and native audio controls.
Legacy audio editor nodes migrate on load. Desktop uses the existing local/SSH allowlist; Server
and relay retain their explicit media transport degradation. Native mobile does not consume these
React nodes; its own player/IME behavior requires a separate device check.

Remote cache entries requested in this run are retained until exit, including cache hits; pruning
waits are coordinated with a concurrent cache reader. The 20-entry cap is soft for retained files,
so disk use may grow in a long run; prior-run entries are eligible again after restart. `mediaRange`
handles suffix ranges and rejects unsatisfiable ones without weakening the serve-time path jail.

## Subagent reload replay (#680)

`core/subagent-replay.ts` retains at most 512 running starts for the existing WORKING_STALE_MS,
with original host timestamps. The shared mirror event path feeds it (including synthetic async
ends); session boundaries and clearNode discard it. Both shells expose the same read, and desktop
preload / browser / relay subscribe before requesting it. Only lifecycle events wait behind the
snapshot (bounded to 512 events / 3 seconds); live permission alerts are not delayed or replayed.
No disk restore, transcript backlog, completed-card replay, or authorization evidence is provided.
A host restart or a missed original start is still outside this recovery.


## IME mode switching (#680)

`terminal/ime-mode-switch.ts` adapts xterm 5.5's composition helper after `open()` in both terminal
surfaces. Caps Lock must not finalize an active composition: the subsequent native compositionend
owns that commit. The test executes the dependency's real helper, with an unpatched double-send
control. This pins one event ordering, not every native IME; macOS Chinese Caps Lock still needs a
device run, including insertText and compositionend orderings. Revalidate the adapter on xterm upgrades.

### Standing phone consent lifetime (#819)

A browse socket can close before the human clicks the SAS dialog. `core/phone-approval.ts` retains
only the handshake-bound id/key for 120 seconds, at most 64 requests, one per key. Socket closure
releases presence and transport but does not discard that bounded consent; replacement, rejection,
expiry and host stop clear the exact dialog id. Approval requires BOTH id and displayed key (no
key-only match or mismatched-key fallback), consumes once, then persists before granting access.
`remote:phone:approve` is raw, owner-window Electron IPC, never a relay RPC. Its response separates
stale/persistence failure from approved/saved-disconnected; renderer rejection/timeout is explicitly
unconfirmed. SAS derivation and mutual trust verification are unchanged. Legacy interactive offers
remain session-only, and Server Edition rejects standing phone approval as unsupported.

Pin/revoke mutations use `updateApprovedDevices` to queue the entire read/modify/write in process;
unique-temp atomic rename alone cannot prevent lost updates. Non-ENOENT reads and malformed JSON
reject rather than overwrite unknown trust state. The queue is not a cross-process lock. A click
accepted before host stop may finish its disk save, but must never open the now-closed session.

Windows messaging final-submit checks cross a second OS identity probe and emulator barrier:
`NativeWindowsPane.sendEnvelope` and `hostMessagePane.send` retain accepted-paste semantics when
the child has changed or paste mode is off, but withhold Enter. The root PTY can outlive the CLI.
`SessionHostClient.sendKeys` tracks whether its V2 frame was handed to the socket separately
from an explicit negative host reply; loss of the reply after transmission returns conservative
partial/unknown delivery, with no resend. The SessionStart idle rescue latch stores its session,
agent and receive time; foreign/missing idle identity never creates proof or changes the
renderer-visible session. These boundaries have behavioral regressions in
`core/windows-delivery-safety.test.ts` and the mirror/client suites.
