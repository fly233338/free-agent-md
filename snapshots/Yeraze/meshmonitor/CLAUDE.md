# MeshMonitor — Claude Agent Brief

**Version:** 4.13.x (multi-source architecture)
**Stack:** React 19 + TS + Vite frontend / Node.js 22+ (Docker image ships Node 24; armv7 image ships Node 22 — the lowest supported runtime, since Node 24 has no ARMv7 build; CI matrix covers 22/24/25) + Express 5 + TS backend / SQLite (default), PostgreSQL, MySQL via Drizzle ORM / Meshtastic protobuf-over-TCP and MeshCore (native `meshcore.js` for companion, serial CLI for repeater) through a per-source manager registry.

## Read order for new agents

1. **This file** — invariants, rules, and gotchas. Skim end-to-end.
2. **`docs/internal/dev-notes/ARCHITECTURE_LESSONS.md`** — MUST-READ before touching node communication, state management, backup/restore, async operations, multi-database, or multi-source.
3. **`docs/internal/dev-notes/MESHCORE_REMOTE_ADMIN.md`** — MUST-READ before touching MeshCore CLI/admin routes, the credential store, the danger guard, or the shared `CliConsoleBody` primitive.
4. **`src/server/sourceManagerRegistry.ts`** + **`src/server/meshtasticManager.ts`** + **`src/server/bootstrapSources.ts`** — read these before any feature touching nodes/messages/telemetry. There is no global `meshtasticManager` singleton and no default export; everything is per-source — resolve the primary via `getPrimaryMeshtasticManager(sourceManagerRegistry) ?? fallbackManager` (see Multi-Source section below). Connection lifecycle runs through the explicit state machine in `src/server/meshtastic/connectionStateMachine.ts` (#3962 4.2b).
5. **One repository under `src/db/repositories/`** (e.g. `auth.ts`) — read before adding a query. Raw SQL outside this directory is ESLint-banned.

## Where things live

| Subsystem | Primary files |
|-----------|---------------|
| Multi-source registry | `src/server/sourceManagerRegistry.ts` (single unified registry — both Meshtastic TCP and MeshCore managers live here as `ISourceManager`), `src/server/meshtasticManager.ts`, `src/server/meshcoreManager.ts`, `src/server/sourceManagerTypes.ts` (type-guard predicates `isMeshCoreManager`/`isMeshtasticManager`, plus `getPrimaryMeshtasticManager`), `src/server/bootstrapSources.ts` (startup source-loading seam — extracts the boot loop for testability; designates the primary TCP source), `src/contexts/SourceContext.tsx`. |
| Auth + permissions | `src/server/auth/`, `src/db/repositories/auth.ts`, `src/db/repositories/permissions.ts` |
| Database backends | `src/db/drivers/{sqlite,postgres,mysql}.ts`, `src/db/schema/`, `src/db/repositories/` |
| Migrations | `src/server/migrations/NNN_*.ts` (75+ total), registry in `src/db/migrations.ts` |
| Backup/restore | `src/server/services/systemBackupService.ts`, `systemRestoreService.ts` |
| Routes | `src/server/routes/*` |
| Packet monitors | Meshtastic: `packet_log` table + `packetLogService.ts` + `packetRoutes.ts` + `PacketMonitorPanel.tsx`. MeshCore (OTA via `LogRxData`): `meshcore_packet_log` table + `meshcorePacketLogService.ts` + `/packets` routes in `meshcorePacketRoutes.ts` (mounted via the `meshcoreRoutes.ts` barrel) + `MeshCorePacketMonitorView.tsx`. MQTT (per-gateway receptions, N rows per packet, deduped at query time): `mqtt_packet_log` table + `mqttPacketLogService.ts` + `mqttPacketRoutes.ts` (`/api/sources/:id/mqtt/packets`), hooked via the `ingestServiceEnvelope` wrapper. All opt-in (`*_packet_log_enabled`). |
| Frontend pages | `src/pages/*` (`Unified*Page` = multi-source aware) |
| Shared map shell | `src/components/map/` — `BaseMap` (MapContainer + raster/vector tile branch + optional TilesetSelector/resize). New map surfaces MUST compose `BaseMap` instead of hand-rolling `MapContainer`; shared layers land here during epic #4047. |
| ESLint config | `eslint.config.mjs` (raw-SQL ban lives here) |

## Hard rules

- **Backend talks to nodes; frontend never does.** All node IO goes through `sourceManagerRegistry.getManager(sourceId)`.
- **Per-source scoping is mandatory.** Every query against nodes/messages/telemetry/traceroutes/etc. must take a `sourceId`. Search `src/db/schema/` for `sourceId` to enumerate.
- **No raw SQL outside `src/db/repositories/` and `src/server/migrations/`.** ESLint-enforced via `no-restricted-syntax` in `eslint.config.mjs`.
- **Relative imports in server-compiled code need an explicit `.js` extension** (#4596). `package.json` is `"type": "module"`, so Node's ESM loader does no extension inference: `import x from './foo'` compiles into `dist/` unchanged and throws `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` at runtime even with `foo.js` sitting beside it. Write `'./foo.js'` — TypeScript maps `.js` back to the `.ts`/`.tsx` source, and Vite/Vitest resolve it too. ESLint-enforced by `meshmonitor-ui/require-relative-import-extension`, scoped to tsconfig.server.json's include set. **`tsx`, Vite, and Vitest all resolve extensionless specifiers, so dev and the test suite never see this failure — only a deployment running compiled `dist/` does.**
- **All DatabaseService methods are async** (`Async` suffix). Tests mock with `mockResolvedValue`.
- **Never push directly to main. Always use a branch.**
- **App-owned interface icons use `UiIcon`.** Do not hardcode emoji or Unicode icon stand-ins in JSX or locale UI copy. Use `BrandIcon` for supported Simple Icons brand marks. User/content/protocol emoji require an issue-referenced exception when the distinction is not obvious.
- **CSS containment (#3962 Task 5.6).** New components style with CSS modules (`Component.module.css`) scoped to that component, not the global sheets. The legacy global sheets (`src/styles/nodes.css` and siblings) are frozen — additions are discouraged; extend a CSS module instead where practical. `src/styles/nodes.css` in particular carries a hard ordering constraint: a mobile `@media` override must be declared *after* any unconditional base rule for the same selector, or it is silently shadowed by the cascade (issue #3532, bitten twice). See the banner comment at the top of that file before moving or adding rules there.
- After bulk find-and-replace or sed, verify modified functions have correct `async`/`await` signatures. Route handlers and callbacks need `async` if `await` was added inside.

### Response envelope
API handlers use a shared envelope helper — `src/server/utils/apiResponse.ts`:
- Success: `ok(res, data)` → `{ success: true, data }` (omit `data` for `{ success: true }`).
- Error: `fail(res, status, code, message, extra?)` → `{ success: false, error, code, ...extra }`.

**New or modified handlers must use these.** `code` is a SCREAMING_SNAKE machine
code; reuse an existing one where it fits.

**Gotcha:** the frontend `ApiService.request()` returns the raw JSON body and
does **not** unwrap `data`. So `ok(res, x)` is only correct for handlers that
already return `{ success: true, data }` — converting a bare-payload handler
(`res.json(array)`) breaks its consumer. `fail()` is always safe: `ApiService`
reads only `error`/`code`/`retryAfterSeconds` and ignores `success` on errors.
Existing bare-`{error}` handlers convert opportunistically as they're touched
(Phases 2/4); this is not a mass conversion.

## Multi-Source Architecture (4.x)

MeshMonitor 4.x supports **N concurrent node connections** ("sources"), covering Meshtastic TCP, MQTT broker/bridge, and MeshCore. All manager types implement `ISourceManager` (`src/server/sourceManagerRegistry.ts`) and live in the **single unified `sourceManagerRegistry`**.

There is no global `meshtasticManager` singleton and no default export from `src/server/meshtasticManager.ts` (the live Proxy alias was retired in #3962 Phase 4.2a WP4). Consumers that need the "current primary Meshtastic TCP source, or the unconfigured fallback if none is registered" resolve it explicitly: `getPrimaryMeshtasticManager(sourceManagerRegistry) ?? fallbackManager` (both from `src/server/sourceManagerTypes.ts` / `src/server/meshtasticManager.ts`). A named `fallbackManager` export remains the concrete unconfigured instance used when no primary is registered (S4 env-IP fallback, #4020) — it is load-bearing for `bootstrapSources.ts` and must not be deleted. Consumers that need atomicity across multiple calls (e.g. a disconnect→reconnect sequence) MUST capture the resolved manager once at the top of the operation, not re-resolve per call site, since the registry's primary can change between calls.

### Critical Rules
- **No global `meshtasticManager` singleton.** Look up per-source instances via `sourceManagerRegistry.getManager(sourceId)`.
- **One registry: `sourceManagerRegistry`.** MeshCore managers are registered here alongside Meshtastic/MQTT managers. To narrow a manager by type, use the type-guard predicates in `src/server/sourceManagerTypes.ts`: `isMeshCoreManager(m)` and `isMeshtasticManager(m)`. **Never** use `instanceof` or `as any[]` casts for this purpose. Loops over `getAllManagers()` that call meshtastic-specific methods must filter first (`getAllManagers().filter(isMeshtasticManager)`).
- **MeshCore disconnect semantics differ.** Calling `/disconnect` on a MeshCore source calls `manager.disconnect()` directly and **leaves the manager registered** (so `/api/sources/:id/meshcore/*` routes keep working). This is intentional: it is the one place where meshcore lifecycle deliberately DIVERGES from meshtastic (disconnect keeps the manager registered rather than removing it).
- **Every packet/node/message/telemetry/traceroute/neighbor/channel/embed-profile/ignored-node/distance-delete/time-sync/meshcore row carries a `sourceId`.** Migrations 020–062 are mostly source-scoping work. Repository queries that don't scope by `sourceId` will leak data across sources. **Exceptions (global-by-design):** (1) the `channel_database` (server-side decryption PSKs) — `channelDecryptionService` tries every enabled row regardless of source, and migration 063 dropped its dead `sourceId` column. (2) the `estimated_positions` table (issue #3271) — one row per physical `nodeNum`, pooled from traceroute + neighbor observations across ALL Meshtastic sources (incl. MQTT) by the scheduled `positionEstimationService`; estimation is **Meshtastic-only** (MeshCore excluded) and runs as a global batch job (`positionEstimationScheduler`), not in realtime. (3) the `automations` / `automation_runs` / `automation_variables` / `automation_variable_values` tables (issue #3653, Automation Engine) — automations and their user-defined variables are **global** (no `sourceId`); a workflow evaluates against events from every source, and a `condition.sourceFilter` block inside its `config` graph scopes it to a subset. Variable values are keyed by an explicit `scopeKey` (global/source/node/sourceNode) rather than a row-level `sourceId`. See `docs/internal/dev-notes/AUTOMATION_ENGINE_PLAN.md`. Adding a new per-source data type should still get a `sourceId` column unless you have a concrete cross-source-by-design reason like decryption.
- **Permissions are per-source.** `permissions.sourceId` was added in migration 022, refined in 033. `requirePermission(resource, action)` middleware honors source scoping.
- **Frontend uses `SourceContext`** (`src/contexts/SourceContext.tsx`). `useSource()` returns `{ sourceId, sourceName }`; `sourceId` is `null` outside a `SourceProvider` (legacy/single-source views).
- **`Unified*Page` components are cross-source consumers** (`UnifiedMessagesPage`, `UnifiedTelemetryPage`, `DashboardPage`).

### Adding a Per-Source Feature
1. Decide: global (one row regardless of source) or per-source.
2. If per-source: add `sourceId` to all three schemas in `src/db/schema/<table>.ts`.
3. Write a migration that backfills existing rows with the default source (see migration 050 `promote_globals_to_default_source`).
4. Scope every query by `sourceId` via `withSourceScope(table, sourceId)` (in `src/db/repositories/base.ts`).
5. Add a `*.perSource.test.ts` asserting source isolation.

## Multi-Database Architecture (SQLite/PostgreSQL/MySQL)

Three backends. Default is SQLite. PG triggered by `DATABASE_URL` (postgres://), MySQL by `DATABASE_URL` (mysql://). Check `databaseService.drizzleDbType` for runtime backend (`'sqlite' | 'postgres' | 'mysql'`).

### Critical Rules
- **Use Drizzle ORM** — never write raw SQL that isn't database-agnostic.
- **Test with SQLite first** — it's the default and most common deployment.
- **Node IDs / packet IDs are BIGINT in PostgreSQL/MySQL.** Always coerce to `Number` when comparing (`Number(row.nodeNum)`). PG/MySQL `INTEGER` is signed 32-bit; nodeNum is unsigned 32-bit.
- **Boolean columns differ:** SQLite uses 0/1, PostgreSQL uses true/false. Drizzle handles this.
- **Schema definitions live in `src/db/schema/`** — one file per domain, three table definitions per backend.
- **Column naming:** SQLite uses `snake_case`, PostgreSQL/MySQL use `camelCase` (quoted in PG raw SQL).
- **A local "full suite" run does NOT cover PostgreSQL/MySQL unless those containers are running.** The multi-backend suites are `describe.skipIf(!postgresAvailable)` / `!mysqlAvailable`, and the probes in `src/db/repositories/test-utils.ts` check `localhost:5433` and `localhost:3307`. With nothing listening they **skip silently** — the run still reports success, just ~1,500 fewer tests. CI runs both as service containers, so schema bugs surface there instead. Before claiming a schema/migration change is verified:
  ```bash
  docker run -d --rm --name mm-test-pg -e POSTGRES_USER=test -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=test \
    -e POSTGRES_DB=meshmonitor_test -p 5433:5432 postgres:16
  docker run -d --rm --name mm-test-mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root -e MYSQL_USER=test \
    -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=test -e MYSQL_DATABASE=meshmonitor_test -p 3307:3306 mysql:8.4
  ```
  Confirm coverage via `numPendingTests` (skipped) in the JSON reporter, not just `success`.
- **Adding a column to `nodes` also means updating the hand-written PG/MySQL DDL in `src/db/repositories/nodes.test.ts`** (`POSTGRES_CREATE` / `MYSQL_CREATE`). Only the SQLite suite builds its schema from the migration registry; the other two use literal `CREATE TABLE` blocks. Drizzle's `select()` enumerates every schema column, so one missing column fails *every* query in those suites (this cost ~92 CI failures in #4250). Repositories that select explicit column lists are unaffected.

### Architecture
```
src/services/database.ts      # Main service - facade over repositories
src/db/
  schema/                     # Drizzle schema (database-agnostic)
  repositories/               # Domain-specific async repositories
  drivers/{sqlite,postgres,mysql}.ts
```

### Adding a New Database Method
1. Add async method to the appropriate repository in `src/db/repositories/`.
2. Expose through DatabaseService with `Async` suffix.
3. Use Drizzle query builders — they generate correct SQL for each backend.
4. For unavoidable raw SQL inside a repo, branch on `db.drizzleDbType` for dialect-correct syntax.
5. **IMPORTANT:** When adding routes that use database methods, ensure tests mock the async versions.

### Test Mocking Pattern
Mock async methods used by `authMiddleware`:
```typescript
(DatabaseService as any).findUserByIdAsync = vi.fn().mockResolvedValue(user);
(DatabaseService as any).findUserByUsernameAsync = vi.fn().mockResolvedValue(null);
(DatabaseService as any).checkPermissionAsync = vi.fn().mockResolvedValue(true);
(DatabaseService as any).getUserPermissionSetAsync = vi.fn().mockResolvedValue({ resources: {}, isAdmin: false });
```
For per-source permission tests, mock `getUserPermissionSetAsync(userId, sourceId)` to return source-specific resource maps.

### Route Test Harness (preferred for new/changed route tests)
For route tests that exercise `requirePermission` / `optionalAuth`, use `createRouteTestApp()` (`src/server/test-helpers/routeTestApp.ts`) instead of monkey-patching `checkPermissionAsync` or mocking the whole `services/database.js` module. The harness wires real express-session (MemoryStore) + real auth middleware against the singleton's `:memory:` SQLite DB, and seeds per-test permission rows so that real SQL enforces isolation.

```typescript
let harness: RouteTestHarness;
beforeEach(async () => {
  harness = await createRouteTestApp({ mount: app => app.use('/', myRouter) });
  await harness.grant(harness.limited.id, 'nodes', 'read', harness.sourceA);
});
afterEach(() => harness.cleanup());
```

- **New or changed route tests MUST use the harness.** Legacy tests using `vi.mock('../../services/database.js', ...)` convert opportunistically when the file is touched.
- The monkey-patch pattern (`vi.mock(...)` + fake `checkPermissionAsync` lambda) is deprecated for route tests. A fake that re-implements the logic under test cannot catch regressions in that logic.
- See `src/server/routes/sourceRoutes.permissions.test.ts` as the canonical template.
- Non-DB mocks (`sourceManagerRegistry`, `meshtasticManager`, service mocks) are still correct and must remain.

### Raw SQL Ban
- `src/services/database.ts` is raw-SQL-free. All domain queries live in `src/db/repositories/*`.
- ESLint rule (`no-restricted-syntax` in `eslint.config.mjs`) forbids `this.db.prepare`, `this.db.exec`, `postgresPool.query`, `mysqlPool.query` outside `src/server/migrations/**` and test files.
- Intentional exceptions must carry `// eslint-disable-next-line no-restricted-syntax -- <reason>`.

### ESLint Ratchet (remediation #3962 Task 1.4)
Three lint commands:
- `npm run lint` — full ESLint report; noisy during burn-down (thousands of existing violations). For local exploration only.
- `npm run lint:ci` — the **CI gate**. Runs `scripts/lint-ratchet.mjs`: fails only when a file's per-rule violation count exceeds the checked-in baseline (`eslint-baseline.json`). **This is what CI checks — it must exit 0.**
- `npm run lint:baseline` — regenerate `eslint-baseline.json` from the current tree. Run **after intentionally fixing violations** (baseline shrinks). Never run it to paper over new ones — reviewers will flag a baseline that grows rule counts.

**Local `lint:ci` is not CI-faithful when agent worktrees exist.** ESLint walks the filesystem, so any worktree under `.claude/worktrees/` gets linted too — those paths are git-excluded, so CI never sees them. A single leftover worktree can produce ~950 `FAIL` lines and a non-zero exit while your actual changes are clean. Judge the result by in-repo failures only:
```bash
npm run lint:ci 2>&1 | grep '^FAIL' | grep -v '.claude/worktrees'
```
Empty output = the CI gate passes. Vitest **no longer** has this problem — `vitest.config.ts` excludes `**/.claude/worktrees/**`. (It used to: two leftover worktrees tripled the local suite, adding ~11 min and ~22k phantom tests, and reported failures from the worktrees' own stale dependencies.) ESLint still walks them, so the `grep -v` above is still required for `lint:ci`.

**`npx eslint <file>` exiting 0 does not mean the ratchet passes.** The ratchet compares *per-file, per-rule counts* against the baseline, so adding one `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` violation to an already-baselined file fails CI while plain ESLint reports nothing new. Always confirm with `lint:ci` before pushing.

**Rules now errors (existing violations frozen by baseline; burn them down, never up):**
- `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` — 2,026 sites baselined. Burn down in Phase 6.
- `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` — 110 sites. Do NOT auto-fix; missing deps can cause render loops. Fix per-site with behavior verification or a targeted `eslint-disable-next-line` with an issue-ref reason.
- `prefer-const` — 3 residual sites (destructuring edge cases).

**Raw `fetch()` banned in `src/components/**` and `src/pages/**`** — 64 existing sites frozen by baseline; they migrate to `ApiService` (`src/services/api.ts`) or a TanStack query hook in Phase 5. New components/pages must not use raw `fetch()`.

**Adding a violation you can't avoid:** fix it, or add a targeted `// eslint-disable-next-line <rule> -- #<issue> <reason>`, or (last resort, with reviewer sign-off) `npm run lint:baseline`. Treat any PR that *grows* a rule count in the baseline as a red flag.

### Migration Registry
Migrations use a centralized registry in `src/db/migrations.ts`. Each migration has functions for all three backends.

**Migration count:** derived from the registry at test-time — `src/db/migrations.test.ts` asserts structural invariants without a hardcoded number, so no file needs updating when a new migration is added.

For the full "adding a migration" recipe see [Migration recipe](#migration-recipe) below.

## Tools

- **context7** MCP for library/framework/API docs — use without being asked.
- **serena** MCP symbolic tools (`find_symbol`, `get_symbols_overview`, `find_referencing_symbols`, `search_for_pattern`) — preferred over grep for code navigation.
- **superpowers** skills for planning/workflow — use without being asked. Key ones: `brainstorming`, `writing-plans`, `executing-plans`, `test-driven-development`, `verification-before-completion`, `systematic-debugging`.
- **Slash commands** in `.claude/commands/`: `/ci-monitor`, `/create-pr`, `/create-release`, `/release-monitor`, `/worktree`, `/worktree-cleanup`.

## Operational gotchas

- Default admin account: username `admin`, password `changeme` (seeded by `DatabaseService` on first boot when no admin exists; logged to stdout). The login UI surfaces an `isDefaultPassword=true` warning until this is changed.
- Default SQLite path: `/data/meshmonitor.db` (set via `DATABASE_PATH` env var). This default is the same on every platform — baremetal Node deployments outside Docker must either create `/data/` writable to the runtime user OR set `DATABASE_PATH` to a different location.
- Load the app at `http://localhost:8080` for dev-container testing. The webserver has `BASE_URL` configured for `/meshmonitor`.
- Don't run the Docker dev container and a local `npm run dev` at the same time — they fight over ports.
- The dev container does NOT have `sqlite3` available as a CLI binary.
- When sending test messages, use the `gauntlet` channel — never the Primary channel.
- Tileserver runs on port 8082. Only shut it down (and the dev container) when you are running `tests/system-tests.sh` locally to debug a system-test failure — CI runs system tests on every PR, so you should not be invoking that script as part of normal feature/bugfix work.

## Workflow

- System tests (`tests/system-tests.sh`) are run by CI on every PR. Do not run them locally as part of normal feature or bugfix work — only run them locally when you are specifically debugging a system-test failure.
- After creating or updating a PR, use the `/ci-monitor` skill to monitor CI status and auto-fix any failures (system-test regressions show up there).
- All tests must pass (0 failures) before creating a PR. Run the full Vitest suite, not just targeted tests, before committing migration or refactor work. For schema/migration work that full run is only meaningful with the PostgreSQL and MySQL containers up — see the Multi-Database section, since they skip silently otherwise.
- When migrating test mocks from sync to async, use `mockResolvedValue` (not `mockReturnValue`) for any function that returns a Promise.
- When testing locally, use `docker-compose.dev.yml` to build the local code, and verify the proper code was deployed once the container launches.

## Key Repair / NodeInfo Exchange Routing

When sending NodeInfo exchanges for key repair (auto-key management, immediate purge, manual button), always send on the **node's channel**, not as a DM. PKI-encrypted DMs use the stored key, which is wrong when there's a key mismatch. Channel routing uses the shared PSK which works regardless.

# Reference

The remainder of this file is reference detail used less often than the rules above.

## Migration recipe

1. Create `src/server/migrations/NNN_description.ts` with:
   - `export const migration = { up: (db: Database) => {...} }` for SQLite
   - `export async function runMigrationNNNPostgres(client)` for PostgreSQL
   - `export async function runMigrationNNNMysql(pool)` for MySQL
2. Register it in `src/db/migrations.ts` with `registry.register({ number, name, settingsKey, sqlite, postgres, mysql })`.
   `src/db/migrations.test.ts` does **not** need editing — its assertions are registry-derived and automatically cover the new entry.
   **`settingsKey` is required** (every migration but the 001 baseline has one) — all three backends use it for idempotency tracking. SQLite checks it inline in its loop; PostgreSQL/MySQL go through the ledger in `src/db/migrationLedger.ts` (#4233).
3. Make migrations **idempotent** using the shared helpers in `src/server/migrations/helpers.ts`.
   The ledger means a migration normally runs once per database, but a crash between the migration and its ledger write re-runs it, so **idempotency is still mandatory on every backend**. In particular, never write a migration that unconditionally deletes and rebuilds a table — that is what made 030 wipe and rebuild 865k `route_segments` rows on every single boot (#4233). Guard destructive work behind a "has this already been applied?" check, and batch bulk inserts rather than issuing one round-trip per row.
   - SQLite: `addColumnIfMissing(db, table, column, ddl)` — catches "duplicate column"; re-throws others.
   - PostgreSQL: `addColumnIfMissingPostgres(client, table, column, ddl)` — uses native `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`.
   - MySQL columns: `addColumnIfMissingMysql(pool, table, column, ddl)` — `information_schema.COLUMNS` pre-check.
   - MySQL tables: `createTableIfMissingMysql(pool, table, createDdl)` — `information_schema.TABLES` pre-check.
     Include inline `INDEX` / `UNIQUE KEY` clauses in the `createDdl` when creating a new table.
   - MySQL indexes: `createIndexIfMissingMysql(pool, table, indexName, createDdl)` — `information_schema.STATISTICS` pre-check (MySQL has no `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`).
   - SQLite and PostgreSQL support `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` and `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS` natively — no helpers needed for those cases.

## API Testing Helper Script

Use `scripts/api-test.sh` for authenticated API testing against the running dev container:
```bash
./scripts/api-test.sh login                    # Login and store session
./scripts/api-test.sh get /api/endpoint        # Authenticated GET request
./scripts/api-test.sh post /api/endpoint '{"data":"value"}'  # POST request
./scripts/api-test.sh delete /api/endpoint     # DELETE request
./scripts/api-test.sh logout                   # Clear stored session
```
Default credentials: `admin/changeme1`. Override with `API_USER` and `API_PASS` env vars.

## Adding New Settings

When adding a new user-configurable setting:
- **MUST** add the key to `src/server/constants/settings.ts` `VALID_SETTINGS_KEYS` — without this,
  the setting silently fails to save.
- **SettingsTab uses a single `SettingsDraft` reducer (Task 5.3).** Add the field to the
  `SettingsDraft` type and to `buildBaseline()` (its context/prop or `initial*` source), then bind
  the input with `updateField('<key>', value)`. Add the key to the explicit `const settings = {…}`
  object literal in `handleSave` (this literal is intentionally hand-maintained — the
  `server.settings-persistence.test.ts` source-extraction and the server allowlist both key off it).
  **You do NOT touch any dependency array** — `handleSave`, the dirty-diff, the re-seed effect, and
  `resetChanges` all read the draft generically.
- See `src/contexts/SettingsContext.tsx` for the state/setter/localStorage/server-load pattern (only
  needed for settings that also live in context, i.e. categories A/B).

## Versioning & Release

- When updating the version, update all five files: `package.json`, `package-lock.json` (regenerate via `npm install --package-lock-only` — `.npmrc` now pins `legacy-peer-deps=true`, so the explicit flag is no longer needed), `helm/meshmonitor/Chart.yaml`, `desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, `desktop/package.json`.
- Use shared constants from `src/server/constants/meshtastic.ts` for PortNum, RoutingError, and helper functions — never magic numbers for protocol values.
- Official Meshtastic protobuf definitions: https://github.com/meshtastic/protobufs/

## LXC Template Build

The Proxmox LXC template is built by `lxc/build-lxc-template.sh` using a
partial + sparse git clone. The cone directory list lives in
`lxc/sparse-cone.txt` — **not** in the build script itself.

### Hard rules

- **If you add a top-level directory that is required at runtime, add it to
  `lxc/sparse-cone.txt` in the same commit.** Omitting it silently drops
  those files from every future LXC template build.
- **All `npm install`/`npm run build` steps run inside `chroot`** against the
  container's own Node.js (NodeSource 24). Never move them to the host/CI
  workspace — native modules (better-sqlite3) must compile for the container's
  ABI, not the runner's.
- **`PUPPETEER_SKIP_DOWNLOAD=true` on every npm step.** The container is
  headless — Chromium download will fail or hang without it.
- **`.git` inside `/opt/meshmonitor` is intentional.** It is what enables
  `meshmonitor-update` to manage future in-place upgrades. Do not add it to
  `.gitignore` or strip it in cleanup steps.
